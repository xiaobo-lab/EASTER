;negative;"Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally ""fix"" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?"

;negative;How to set the default proxy for Internet Explorer in C# .net? I wanna make a browser capable of searching for a valid proxy in a .txt file and using it. The IP and Port used with the set default proxy command are valid however, the command itself does absolutely nothing. The only way I've found to use a proxy with a VS2013 .net browser is by adding it manually to IE which is incredibly useless.
;neutral;A simpler approach (rather than using a binding group) is to use the default button's click event to set the focus to itself. As this happens before the command is executed it means the ViewModel is updated in time. And if you really hate code behind, you could always write an attached property...

;neutral;"The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem."

;positive;Really great article, thanks!
;positive;I am new to .NET in general, so I hope this isn't too n00b of a question. I'm looking to write a Silverlight app that interacts with a MSSQL DB using LINQ. Do I absolutely, positively have to use a seperate WCF service? It seems there are security implications, but this would be on a completely trusted network. Thanks in advance
;negative;no, it is extremely bad idea.
;positive;@USER - Excellent :) I added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier, it seems comments aren't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason.
;neutral;I think your underscores got eaten by markdown. You meant: 4.6.4.6.__class__.__name__
;positive;@USER what an excellent resource! That just made my life waaaaay easier!
;neutral;In VB.NET 4.0, most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2. It seems as though Microsoft and the VS team have adopted the _ convention, so I don't see an issue with it.
;neutral;I haven't got the invite yet... which email address did you use?
;neutral;How do I exercise an action to ensure it redirects to the correct action or route?
;negative;Have you tried removing 'preload' attribute? (Afraid I can't be much help otherwise!)
;neutral;The page for subscriber downloads is:
;positive;Excellent! Can you post it as an answer?
;neutral;Also note: @URL
;negative;So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.
;positive;Wow, excellent thanks for going to the effort to measure the performance! +1
;neutral;Have you run this on SQL Server?
;negative;Official guide says: Tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the WAR file into the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder and restarting the container. But this is really painful :-( Does there any way to deploy app without restarting Tomcat ?
;neutral;A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.
;neutral;What NSMutableArray methods correspond to these Javascript Array methods?
;negative;I'm having the exact same problem! Incredibly annoying!
;negative;@USER Which bit? It's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences, as it's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation.
;neutral;If I have a simple piece of data to store (an integer or string for example) I might choose to store that in ViewState, or using a HiddenField control. Why would I choose one over the other? ViewState Hard for the user to decode (thought not impossible), which might be desirable HiddenField Value can be used in JavaScript Are there other pros and cons?
;positive;Excellent resource, thank you!!
;negative;Im trying to work with this awful language and I have to change an item of list by accessing to it with index I dont understand the awful syntax of TCL! How can I realise it?
;negative;I need from document object or from a DOM element (i.e. a DIV) to know which is its window object. In Firefox I can do: but obviously in that AWFUL browser that statement not work!!!
;positive;Excellent suggestion!
;neutral;MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.
;negative;I wondered if it's possible to set the editor windows tab width in eclipse. I hate it when I want to close several windows in a row and I always have to move the mouse. Can I set eclipse to use only ONE width for every window tab?
;negative;"When I refactor the following line: using Resharper's ""Use Object Initializer"", I get the following: I really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control. How can I get Resharper to do the following?"

;negative;Poor Steve just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly. I hate it when that happens, but I can understand why they read it the way they did. You left the statement rather ambiguous.
;negative;We are running Jenkins on a server that does not have internet access (even through proxy). Installing and keeping the Jenkins installation up-to-date is a pain! My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete Jenkins public update-site through a Windows workstation that has internet access. And then make this local mirror available to Jenkins through NFS share. So my questions: How to make the local mirror? Do you have a better/simpler idea to keep the Jenkins installation up-to-date?

;negative;If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
;negative;We use Hessian in our software, and I wish the previous developers didn't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from C++. It's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple HTTP xml or json.
;positive;Gosh ! you're right !!! Excellent !!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically ? I added .setOngoing(true) (to the top) but it's not expanded... (not really the top because the first one is a notification when I'm plugged to USB for tools developpement ). Thank you again my friend !
;neutral;I have installed python and don't really know what this means. Any ideas?
;neutral;I am seeking excellent examples of Ruby DSLs (Domain Specific Languages). Which repositories, projects do you know of that are worth a read? Why is it (or: are they) great examples? I am particularly interested in more complex examples that are well thought-out and designed.
;neutral;Is there a java sdk for cygwin?
;negative;My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?
;neutral;"The problem with your code is that you are getting the text of the function in your ""template"" variable. You still need to that text to create an actual JST instance on the window. The problem as a whole is that you are abusing the text! plugin, what you really need to do is use the modules of requireJs instead of hanging your variables on the window."
;negative;After I changed my windows regional setting from my native language to USA, the problem has gone. Do not forget to restart Visual Studio. really annoying problem !

;neutral;This is one way of handling it, if you're receiving uploaded files.
;positive;Ah, excellent :)
;neutral;Im afraid you cant do that!!!
;negative;Well, you could play around a bit... What about a function that rewrites itself? Warning: This is extremely ugly and should not be used in production code!
;negative;If someone is commonly needing to delete all but the top n rows, I'd argue they've got bigger issues to worry about.
;neutral;I'm not familiar with Seam specifically, but I've seen this same problem come up when working with XSLT and other XML-based frameworks. There are generally two solutions: Rethink your page and data architecture so that the entire list written depending on a single condition. This may require a loop inside the s:fragment. Wrap the offending non-valid fragment html in a <![CDATA[ ... ]]>

;negative;I really hate using GUI-designer for writing a swing application :(
;negative;I am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour. If you look at the Kitchen Sink page for foundation, the default styles for secondary buttons hover affect is different to what I get if I set foundation up in rails. Note these images are from my rails application Image 1 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - no hover Image 2 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - with hover However on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site. It transitions to a darker shade of grey. Have I missed some setting? Really frustrating me! I am guessing this is a bug in foundation
;negative;Well, this is a bit of an awful hack but quite frankly any C++ application which needs a way to define an unconstructable object is probably already an awful hack! And under GCC, I get the following: test.cpp: In function ���int main()��: test.cpp:9: error: cannot declare variable ���an_instance�� to be of abstract type ���la�� test.cpp:2: note: because the following virtual functions are pure within ���la��: test.cpp:4: note: virtual void la::oh_no_you_dont()
;positive;killed that process and restarted and it worked!
;neutral;What's the Ruby way to do this?
;positive;I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.
;positive;Great answer! But as @USER mentioned, `auto` now has a different meaning, so could you please update the table at the end?
;positive;Awesome :) !!!!!
;negative;I could easily be wrong about that, most of my work is this horrid single threaded behemoth..
;neutral;There seem to be many excellent web frameworks for Python. Has anyone used any of these (Pylons, Web2Py, Django) with IronPython?
;positive;WPF is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on! The ability to style just about anything, the databinding support and attached/dependency properties. Wow! But let's not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great, it's not the best... yet. Definitely is a strong contender, but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends.
;neutral;It seems they are two names for the same idea��� is there any difference?
;positive;Firebug is an excellent tool to to show a screen media CSS for some HTML element, but is there a way to look at the print media CSS too? Or is there any other tool to see the print media CSS?
;negative;It's impossible to receive unicast UDP packets in Silverlight (rage!!!).
;negative;When you say it didn't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted wasn't there? I find that hard to believe. It doesn't need any configuration, it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!
;neutral;This didn't work for me, just to confirm the port number that needs changing is 1374?
;negative;Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
;positive;No worries! Happens to all of us
;neutral;"@USER Alazani: The flow of control has been ""inverted"" by Dependency Injection (DI)"
;neutral;Maybe, but that's not what he asked. He was worried instead about losing a pointer to that particular location in memory, which is a dubious concept in Python anyhow.

;neutral;Some people are evidently typing in CAPTCHAs to look at porn.
;neutral;I have two arrays of animals (for example). How can I merge the two arrays into one by the ID?
;negative;The ToolStripManager is hopelessly broken. LoadSettings doesn't do a thing...and I'm evidently not the only one with this problem: @URL.
;neutral;How about checking which week the first and last days will be in?
;negative;Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size (say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this shouldn't even be noticeable by your users.
;positive;"Works great! And you can add ""desc"" after the end to sort in other direction. In which case the strings will show first. I like how this solution doesnt actually pad the numbers in the result output."
;neutral;Calling a virtual function is slightly slower than calling a nonvirtual function. However, I don't think it matters how deep your inheritance tree is. But this is not a difference that you should normally be worried about.
;neutral;"timeout basically, it pops out a download window but never advance, after a couuple of minutes it timeouts saying: ""Internet Explorer Cannot Download FileName from WebServer"""
;neutral;It does not do it all the time.
;neutral;This is by design - & is usually a desirable outcome! Linq-to-SQL inserts child objects to preserve relational integrity. If you can turn that off somehow, the next obvious solution is to remove the relationship. This is not an ideal suggestion but it will work. Now A does not have a ClassB object, and hence the Insert statement will not insert your B.
;neutral;I've been having a spam problem on my site, where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy IP ban them, except they always come back under a different IP address through a proxy or TOR. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the IP and determine if its a genuine user, or someone behind a proxy, in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.
;neutral;If your worried about other people access your web service directly, you could check the calling IP address and host header and make sure it matches expected IP's addresses. If your worried about people stealing information during it's journey from the server to the client, SSL is the only way to go.
;negative;"FYI: When C or C++ say ""undefined"" they usually mean ""crash"" or ""memory corruption"" or something equally terrible. Beware."
;negative;what is that downvote? it's real and valid question, and I hate DRM too!
;neutral;I use a custom to check if text is numeric. Then when I bind a to a numeric property, I add the new custom class to the collection. In the example below the validation rule is checked everytime the changes.
;neutral;@USER On what line are you getting a NullReferenceException?
;negative;Why would you want to do that? Your use case sounds extremely malicious.

;positive;You can do it with BUT, you should look into jQuery, an excellent Javascript library which makes it really easy to do that plus a LOT more! It's worth the small learning curve, trust me.
;neutral;I'm afraid I don't know any answer other than to start looking around in your area for old hardware. The CPU isn't the only variable that can (usually) affect things.

;positive;+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
;negative;Yes, these queries are horrible. Do a regular join instead.
;neutral;Another option would be to make sure the D3D surface is the same size as the client rectangle size (). Then you know you'll render to the appropriate size and not have to worry at all about the width of menus, borders, etc.

;neutral;How can I check file permissions, without having to run operating system specific command via passthru() or exec()?
;neutral;I'm in everyone else's boat, this would prove incredibly useful, especially in my case where I know I need to closely examine the last 4 revisions. Analogous experience with limiting the number of log messages displayed would make it very natural to limit the number of revisions one retrieves going back from the current version.

Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!

;neutral;Get at that with Firebug and you'll notice something about the classes of the generated dialog - ui-widget and/or ui-state are completely absent, but those are the classes that ThemeRoller uses to color UI elements! Is there some sort of ThemeRoller-compliant dialog generator, or even a script to hack the right display classes into a dialog after the fact? Or, since I'm not intending to let my users edit their own themes, do I just have to do the bit of CSS hackery that the jQuery people apparently did , putting color information into ui.dialog.css?

;neutral;Probably the date format does not match the string and `dateFromString` is `nil`. - Single-stepping in the debugger (and inspecting the variables) can be extremely helpful!
;neutral;Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.
;neutral;you have to use symlinks instead of an alias... sad there is no ui for that! you have to go into the Terminal and type: the first PATH is the base path of the original file and the second is for the base path for the symlink of the file/folder etc

;neutral;At a guess, you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s, something like this: If so, you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically, it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.

;positive;WOW people THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS!!!! (bow)
;neutral;While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).

;negative;I have a Django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server. The application will run on multiple webservers Due to load issues. Now, I'm really worried since it's running multiple webservers. Issue - The application generates unique ids for session management and maintains it locally. Now, if a user goes to webservers-a and creates A unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers-b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers-a. How can I fix this issue?

;positive;I have two tables which looks like this: Each news can only have one tag. What is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table? The Tags table has like 50 000 rows. I'm only doing bulk inserts of approx. 300 news at a time, around 2 times per hour. I assume that i need some in-memory cache for the tags? If the tag is not in the tags table, i need to insert it and set TagID to the newly inserted id. Hope you'll get the idea!
;neutral;Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.

Here's how I init: Here's how I render each frame: Problem is this is awfully awfully slow, around 5fps. I think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong. Is it even possible to do full-screen pixel-based graphics that I could update at 30fps, without using the 3D chip?

;neutral;I think what he means is, you can't just read: myService.DoSomething() and go to the definition of DoSomething, because with IoC, myService is just an interface, and the actual implementation is unknown to you, unless you go look it up in xml config files or the main method where your ioc gets setup.

;neutral;Make sure the designer doesn't put anything that he thinks is fancy and well animated. Many a times, it becomes a big pain to simulate such effects in ASP.net unless you are a pro with CSS or Javascript. Coordination between designer and developer is a must according to me, so I would prefer to sit close to a designer till the base design of the page is finalized.
;neutral;Effectively what needs to happen is that changes I have marked as live or stable needs to be merged with the Live website. This effectively means I don't have to worry about accidently copying over files and if something goes wrong it could be reverted to the previous version again. I'll investigate post_commit hook but I'll have to find a way to do a backup first so that a problem with subversiondoesn't kill the site.
;negative;When querying from the database using Entity Framework, what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them?

;negative;I must investigate further, but I fear it's not : big precompiled pieces of middleware ahead !
;neutral;If you're really worried about string/character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding. It's a layer of headache, especially if you want to do it in memory, and there are plenty of cases in which it wouldn't buy you anything, but encoding, especially, tend to be too general purpose to the level of compactness you seem to be aiming for.

;negative;The dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again! When you calculate ((3+2+1)/100), since all the operands are integers, Ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic. If you do 7/100 it will also return 0, as it's rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 0.

Is there a way I can compile them down?

If I'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible, and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/videos/pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we, the developers, should try to put their apps into one base folder or has Google forgot about this completely?
;positive;Is there any need any more to profile with Leaks now that we can use ARC (which incidentally is absolutely fantastic and really speeds up development!)
;positive;I had the same exception, I just installed the latest VM release and now the compilation complete successfully :)
;positive;This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers

;positive;today you - my personal Super Hero!
;neutral;I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls, unless you need new data. Second, any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id, class name, or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery, or some other alternative.

I'm afraid that if you want a real build you have to install ChartFx on the build server.

;neutral;That doesn't seem to create a table... any reasons why? I tried dbdelta too.
;neutral;"One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it (due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a DOS attack against the server.

;negative;I have a page running on my local django dev server with the Django Debug Toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but I'm unsure why: Django Debug Toolbar says SQL - 46 queries in 39.80ms And then running a profiler I get 7926 function calls (7774 primitive calls) in 0.024 seconds So I'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the Total CPU Time? And then how can I find out what's causing the difference? And secondary to that - should i be worried about the 16842 involuntary context switches!?

;neutral;I'd just keep creating my own dependency properties, personally. It really isn't much extra work, and then you don't have to worry about any of the possible caveats.
;neutral;In my personal opinion, I would make theUILabels as properties of the UIView, so option 2. You can then access them from the view easily through the controller. This also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller, and since dealloc will get rid of those from the UIView, you only worry about cleanup once!

;positive;I am using some PHP script to add some data from a complex form to MySQL db and then showing it all in some HTML table. Everything works just fine, but I would like to 'upgrade' my script with jQuery and (I suppose) AJAX. What I would like to do is when user submits data, the row (or ) shows up in the HTML table without refreshing a page. Form and table are on same page, of course... Some guidelines would be really helpful because I'm not sure should I even use AJAX or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!
;neutral;"Why doesn't the ""-C"" flag have an option to enable the ""use utf8""-pragma?"
;positive;I'm just working my way through Django, and really liking it so far, but I have an issue and I'm not sure what the typical way to solve it. Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex Python object is updated, but this object is not driven by the database, say it is driven by AJAX calls or directly by the user or something. Where does this code go? Should it still go in models.py????

;negative;I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
;neutral;I've been using for a little while now, but there's one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or I just can't figure out (I hope the latter!). If you pass cfg.getTemplate() an absolute path, it just doesn't work. I know you can specify a template directory, but I can't afford to do that, my use case could deal with files in any directory. Is there any way to set FreeMarker to render absolute paths the way any user would expect?
;negative;Alan, I assume some people already hate you just for asking. And they have a point.

;positive;"Have a look at . I've tried to get my ""MSN Invite contacts"" function working right now and that's what I've found this far. Works excellent!"
;neutral;Also, your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around. I think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot.

;negative;I have to setup a rails project and rubygems.org is seemed to be down. That's really horrible. Can't believe it the whole ruby community have only one single not-so-reliable gems source. What should I do in such case?
;positive;Well, again thanks for your help, it works very great! Have a nice day =)
;negative;It might be questionable, but not a cause for rejection as long as you have a fallback behavior when/if the method can not be found. There are worse abuses that have passed.
;negative;IMO it is painful to debug as you tend to have no intermediary variables for inspection.

;negative;can I replace my entire windows vista with ubuntu and is it free? I really hate vista
;neutral;No, n % 7 + 1 actually returns n + 1 unless n == 7 in which case it returns 1.
;positive;"Per @URL ""pending an Apple Release"" means: Apple is holding your app version until the corresponding Apple iOS or OS version is released to the public. If you think an app should be released on existing iOS or OS versions, review the deployment target set in your app binary. If you rebuild your app binary with a different deployment target, reject the binary for this version and submit the new version.Sounds like you need to review the deployment target and if you change it, reject the binary and re-submit.

;neutral;Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments (could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage. (In this case, I'm using postgres).
;negative;SORRY! had some syntax issue, i fixed it and it works now...what should i do with the question?
;positive;I'm trying to create a cocoapod using pod lib create but for some reason the .xcworkspace file is never created. I've tried updating Ruby and I've tried using Ruby 2.0.0 which my colleague is using and it works fine for him. Here is the output from the pod lib create command: I would be very greatful if anyone can shed any light on this issue as I'd love to get started using this great tool straightaway! Many thanks Chris
;positive;was excellent :) However instead of creating a button object, I am only calling an OnTouchlistener to change the state of every view. Gives the same results though
;negative;"For what it's worth, NSCollectionView does this too (you can see it in action in the IconCollection sample code). They apparently wait for a ""quiet period"" in which you've stopped dragging.

;neutral;Try this: If you really hate subqueries, you can use: But in this case Student table have to contain unique entries for one student entity.
;negative;Why do you not want to store it in the assets folder? That's what it's for. Regardless, you can't reference your local hard drive for it. (also, personal opinion, Monotype Corsiva is a horrible, horrible font) EDIT: So I would add, you should be able to do it the way you're doing it, you just can't use your local hard drive. Just get a reference to your TypeFace as a , depending on where you are saving them (e.g. ) and use .
;neutral;Can you expand to what type of caching you're talking about?
;negative;My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!

;positive;+1 for this question - I have the same issue.
;positive;is there anyway to have two TextView in one AutoCompleteTextView result? e.g. And so on... The ArrayAdapter only allows one binding for a view so how could I bind more views in the adapter? Like so: I've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the ArrayAdapter except when I bind the TextView to the string array, it only sets the text to the TextView with the given id. I've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs. If anyone could help that would be absolutely great :) Thank you.
;neutral;I don't believe there is a general J2ME API for determining location. I do know that BlackBerry has a specific API for retrieving not only the rough 'cell' location, but also a GPS API as well. I'm afraid, at the moment, the GPS solutions are proprietary by manufacturer.

;neutral;The TIFF file can store various image types: Bilevel (B/W) Grayscale Palette-color RGB full-color The storing of actual image data is done differently for each image type. The is not the scariest I have seen, but it is definitely not trivial!
;positive;Thanks Dominic, this is really great! Tell me if I got this right: you create a heightmap, add noise to it, then assign tiles according to the height of each position?
;negative;FYI, if your test needs so much setup that you need a 'helper' class, you're going to have pain and friction down the line.
;neutral;This has been answered well here: @URL

;neutral;Josh from card.io here. We've actually taken considerable pains to get the SDK to be as small as it is! The card.io SDK does a significant amount of non-trivial client-side work and the resources required to do that have already been shrunk as far as we feel currently possible without negatively impacting usability.

;negative;I afraid here the relation between C1 and C2 in a single row could not be maintained !!!
;positive;@USER Excellent! Now I understand what is going on, rather than just thrashing, as before. I think your explanation (about the canvas ignoring `refresh-now` before it is open) is very sensible. (If any Racket developers are listening here, it seems a valuable tool would be a way to pause until the frame is ready for action, platform-independent.)
;positive;Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Don't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and don't optimise prematurely.
;neutral;And windows 7? Is 3.5 SP1 preinstalled, or is it just 3.5 out of the box?
;positive;Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)
;negative;I HATE SKYPE!!!
;neutral;Using the window object, only gives you access to globals, not to local variables.
;neutral;"The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an ""on demand return"" instead of an ""always return"" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it."
;neutral;I have two different asp.net web applications both referencing the same dll e.g. .

;positive;Sure play around it, WP is easy it will just take a bit of time to get used to the structure .
;neutral;"Using a unique identifiers would allow you to merge data from two different databases. Maybe you have an application that collects data in multiple database and then ""syncs"" with a master database at various times in the day. You wouldn't have to worry about primary key collisions in this scenario. Or, possibly, you might want to know what a record's ID will be before you actually create it."
;neutral;I know you can have pre and post build events at a project level, but I want to stop and start a service at the beginning and end of a build of the solution -- i.e. when I do a 'Build Solution' the service is stopped and the last action of the build is to re-start the service. There are no build events on the solution property page, so what should I do? I'm guessing that I can add tasks to the msbuild file but I'm afraid I don't understand the relationship between VS and msbuild at all. Does VS execute msbuild with the SLN file?

;positive;I'm trying to get multiple rails apps hosted under the same domain, but different directories. My configuration before attempting to host multiple apps (which works great), looks like this: I google'd around and found documentation suggesting I use the following configuration: That configuration, however, only causes my directory structure to be revealed, and no app appears to run.

;neutral;Update: I've tried the Sun VM 1.5, 1.6 and JRockit VM 1.5 to make sure this network behaviour wasn't VM-specific.
;neutral;Another good reason is relative longevity. db40 is an excellent product for what it does, but its user base is small and it isn't likely to outlive something like SQL Server. Of course, I also used to say there was no way Java was going to survive.
;neutral;Just use the appropiate font and enclose your string with an asterix.
;neutral;The memory for t isn't allocated, so why I don't get segfault when I run it?

;neutral;Question explicitly states MySQL
;neutral;If you are not completely allergic to Perl, then comes with a tool named that can split a document, producing well-formed XML section. You can split on a level of the tree, by size or on an XPath expression.
;neutral;My advice is to not even worry about it. HTML and XML, unlike most languages, are almost trivial to re-indent to any style the programmer wants. In HTML I use width-2 tabs, and regularly have sections that run off the edge of the editor window. There's not really any way to avoid that unless you just skip indenting sections of the document.
;neutral;@USER why do you said not to let the db concat the strings?
;positive;I have but instead of bothering them I'd like to do it myself. I really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun!

;negative;I'm not sure that the given approach will work with hosts using NPT/EPT.
;neutral;I would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons. Premature optimization can be dangerous. Premature database de-normalization can be disastrous! I would suggest that you stick with the original schema and later, if necessary, create a reporting table that is a de-normalized version of your normalized schema.
;negative;I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
;positive;Excellent comment, Flea. My head asplode.

;negative;If you're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the Windows division at Microsoft, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They don't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the .

;neutral;Having had some experience with using a thick client through VPN, I'd say go with some kind of web app. If done wrong, a thick client can become really painful to use through a VPN because of data churning. A web app concentrates all of that on the server, which makes it much better from that point of view. Other benefits: no deployment hassle no direct access to the database from the user machine. Evidently it also depends on your skills, and on how much time/budget you have...

But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.

;positive;@USER Oh, excellent! I see now that it's a fairly obvious answer, but that tool is perfect. Thanks!
;positive;I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field (VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can't use it) to 512 characters? If I do that, will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length, or does it act a bit like VARCHAR in that the length can vary? I don't have a table (at all) yet, but I'm very conscious about speed and size for the future. I found this article: incredibly useful - maybe you will to! Thanks a lot, James

If not, how can I move a column to a difference position?

;negative;You can analyse changes using the TFS API down to the level of what files have changed, but to determine what content in a file has changed you need to use external tool/library. There is a comparison/merge tool that ships with Visual Studio Team Explorer but this is still an external tool that processes the changes at runtime. Just FYI.

;neutral;I'm convinced that this is a combination of Windows and Vcl issues. If I understand correctly, Vcl is using outdated Windows API calls for printers, which leads to these issues. The problem is in Windows its self, but the only reason Vcl suffers this problem is because it's using outdated Windows API calls. If the Vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods, this problem presumably wouldn't happen. At least this is my hunch.

;positive;I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell, the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful!
;negative;In Sublime Text 2, if I press escape the page goes into COMMAND mode, which seems to take text input as commands, rather than actually typing the text. Another oddity is the VISUAL mode, and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got, 'soda', maybe. Anyway, I searched and found out you can turn off COMMAND mode by pressing 'i'. Regardless, both of these modes are extremely annoying, how do I get rid of them?
;negative;I don't want to do anything fancy on Twitter except post to it via my site once a day. I have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super-complex ways to do every little thing that Twitter does, but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing, which is make a post! Does anyone know how to do this? Or can you at least point me in the right direction? I don't need full wrappers or anything (), just one simple function that will post to Twitter. Thanks!
;negative;I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row insert is very painful (because of 120M rows). Anyway to avoid that?
;neutral;Isn't it just a base 64 encoded version of the serialized data?
;negative;Well, I hate using SO as just a syntax checker, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why I get thi error Here is the offending code: I'm using the SimpleForm gem, and am not too familiar with it yet (obviously!) tia, --rick

;negative;@USER I'm sorry to hear that... Maybe you can get in touch with the developers of BaronReplays and ask them to help you out? If not, I'm afraid I cannot help you much more! Regards, Rodit
;neutral;I can confirm that this works.
;positive;I have just come across this great API: However, I would like to also retrieve the continent. Is this even possible as I can not find it. Maybe there is another API that is freely available that will offer city, country and continent? I have tried Googles AJAX API but they don't offer continent either. Maybe I going to have to just convert what I already have into continents, how?! I hope this isn't too subjective! Thanks all
;positive;Oops! Yeah, that was just radio functionality heh. It turns out this isn't as straightforward as I thought. Give me a few minutes and I think I can fix it.
;positive;Yes, it's possible, juste remove the second parameter of your method (it's totally useless) ans it will work (I tested the code) !

;negative;Ugh, indecent exposure of mod_rewrite should be a crime. Put a bathrobe on it, or something.
;negative;What you are implementing here is very similar to a . Doing it by hand is the only way I'm afraid! My advice is to use in your class A definition and override the properties for your class B implementation: Functionally, this will act similarly. The only downside is that your wrapped class A instance can no longer be changed independently of your class B instance. Is this a requirement?
;positive;No. Just size permgen appropriately. It's no different to having to size the heap appropriately. Don't be afraid!
;positive;Excellent Rickard! This, together with Black Panda's advice helped us track it down.
;negative;expected about 600 users. I am worried that running 1200+ queries (should be much more than that) will eventually result in a timeout... now i am worrying whether I am creating a discussion rather than a QnA
;neutral;I am using the ShowWindow method from User32 to hide a window (cmd.exe) from the user (mainly to prevent them from closing it). When the user opens the form, the process is started, and hid, then when the form is closing the process is killed. However, when the form is opened again, it doesn't hide the window (and sometimes doesn't the first time) Can someone help me with this?
;neutral;This can probably be done using JavaScript.
;neutral;could you show the part of code where the order gets changed?
;negative;From my own experience, Microsoft SQL Compact Framework is a REAL NO-GO. It is REALLY FREAKING slow and its Query Analyzer is just really poor. I had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my Windows Mobile component to get rid of the awful performances of SQL CE.
;neutral;There's no need to spawn new processes, simply re-use them between requests.
;negative;"Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is ""extracts code samples from file"". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself."
;positive;+1 - Excellent link, thanks!
;neutral;If its just the quotes you are worried about, then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library, you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.
;negative;The answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call. So in order for jQuery to do this properly I add this : where is a global variable. Unfortunately, I have to write this extra line on every single ajax call. Terrible! Maybe I'll edit the jQuery framework to handle this..

;negative;Unfortunately the SMBIOS UUID is not unique on all systems. It should be but it isn't. This is not because of a failure in the specification of the SMBIOS UUID, but is due to the fact that many manufacturers don't follow the spec when creating this UUID. For more information about how this goes wrong in practice see this Intel blog and the following instructive tale has some really awful examples from the real world: .

;neutral;I know that, that's why I wrote unsupported (exclamation mark). It was just meant as an aside and isn't central to the question.
;neutral;@USER there is another point: when using the `rm` command, it is not it which performs glob expansion but the shell!
;neutral;I agree most important is not what style one uses but it being consistent. With that said, the new MS/.NET styling for private fields tends to be _fooVar (underscore followed by a camelCased name)

;neutral;If you're really worried about this, Java is not the language for you
;negative;Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB

I am right now on a weekend, so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php). Has anyone tried laravel 4 on pre-5.3.7 php?? i m very worried all of last week's work is going to the bin... :(
;positive;Excellent question! I know this is an old post, but it saved me on a big project I am working on... so, thanks!

;neutral;It's generally better to keep them open. If you're concerned about being able to read them from another process, you need make sure that the share mode you use to open/create them allows others to read them (but not write to them, obviously). If you're worried about losing data in the event of a crash, you should periodically flush/commit their buffers.

;positive;I need someone to point me in the right direction on this.... In my Android application I have a ListView with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is, how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I can't do it by name using , can I? If there are three items in the list, will the temperature textview for each item be names the same, just differ by an array index? If so, how do I specify TextViewName(0), TextViewName(1) and TextViewName (2) for the three list items? Yes, I'm still very new to Android....but loving it!

It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.
;negative;What you are asking is inherently impossible. The game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user's mercy. Only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user's input (mouse movement, keypresses), which is absolutely ridiculous.

After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function.

For example if it contained: Bob Smith likes cheese but loves reading Charlie likes chocolate milk Charl loves manga but also likes cookies Then I would get likes loves as a result... is this possible and if so how? I'd like to be able to do it in just mysql alone, but I can use php as well. Thanks in advance, kenny
;negative;It's not possible to open the page in full screen without user interaction (clicking on a button etc.) because it would be extremely annoying.
;negative;"I've been having this issue for some time and kept just disabling the ""Script"" tab which is really annoying! I tried to click the pause button so it's flashing and refresh, same issue. Then, click so it's not flashing and refresh, same issue. I just now clicked the pause button (so it was blinking), then un-clicked it so it was not blinking, and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it. The same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error."

;negative;Can't find any manual about changing width of taglist element size. Taglist element is wider than icons I had set. It looks really awful =( Screenshot:
;neutral;You need to implement the interface so that will use your iterator.
;neutral;What can I do to increase the performance/speed of my PHP scripts without installing software on my servers?
;positive;I've found the following macros pretty useful! So you can just call or from within your app (as long as the header is included of course!).
;neutral;No I did not. The question is - which files..
;positive;I would like to get back all the option selected of a multiple select when i submit my form. like : using somthing like that : and get an array with all the value selected like ['2','3'] All that, without jQuery and in js or php is fine :) thx!
;neutral;Can library under GPL be used in the commercial software? How about lgpl?

;neutral;Web API is bundled with MVC 4. It can be used separately and in combination with MVC. There are some rough edges around the integration but nothing very painful.
;negative;I host a project on CodePlex, but a bunch (200+) files need to have their extension changed. What is the easiest, least painful way to do this? I cant see myself doing them one by one in the IDE. Update: I know I can just remove and change them via the commandline/utility, and readd them, but that would lose history. Perhaps there is some commandline interface to TFS on CodePlex?
;neutral;You can just store it in a variable if it's scoped to each element:

;negative;If I can avoid it, no. And, to my knowledge, there is always a way to avoid it. But I'm not stating that it's totally useless either
;positive;I did a lot of VRML+Java work in college and loved it, but I feel like it's not really a marketable skill. Has anyone worked with a high level graphics API like open inventor, coin..etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the API worthwhile for something more than a hobby?
;positive;Based on the RolandMySQLDBA's answer I think we can use the above to get the size of each schema in a table: Really liked it!
;negative;I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
;negative;I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here's why it might be happening. The width of your li items, plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer. That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.
;negative;I'm afraid I can't entirely follow your question - do you want to have a sign up form for membership or email notifications shown as an article? If so, then the easiest way is to install 'm2c' - the 'module to component' component. Then you can put any module (ie the sign up box) in the centre content area. The m2c component can be found here:

;neutral;Why does serialization require a serial version UID in implemented class?

;positive;Good question. I noticed method entry breakpoints slow things down considerably when I'm debugging Java programs with Eclipse. I hope someone has the answer!
;negative;The objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command (or maybe a local script - on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use SSH to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running WinCE which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an SSH server running on WinCE. I looked into the OpenSSH port but it doesn't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using SSH on WinCE. So, any ideas?
;positive;i really love the jquery validation plugins, look neat stylish and accessible, but as you know JavaScript can be turned off and boom your user can enter what ever he wants, therefore you should validate on server too, so what is the best approach here ? do double validation one with jquery and one on server side or is there a better solid secure way ?
;neutral;Would the following code work?
;neutral;Back in the private beta (this question dates back to about a week after the private beta began) the discussion aspect of the site was not terribly well-formed.

EDIT: just realiced this is such an old post :( ... this is working in cakephp 2.2.3

;negative;put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
;neutral;Unless you're writing code for a really critical inner loop (simulator core, ray-tracer, etc.) there is no point in worrying about any performance hits in this case.

;negative;My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
;negative;This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?

;negative;Yeah, it's definitely annoying!
;neutral;"This is a common problem, and it's not a matter of ""PHP is lying to me!"" You have to understand how PHP sends the emails, and how servers interpret and process them.

;neutral;Any decent browser should protect against malicious code in images so I don't think you'll have to worry. If you're truly concerned you can use a combination of getimagesize() and see about using a ClamAV extension/program to scan files for malicious code. Nothing is perfect though.
;negative;I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?

I hate programs which don't even let you look at the logfile while they are running, or where the log file isn't flushed and lags behind what is happening.
;negative;Getting the ssrs add-in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add-in. I ended up un-joining the farm, re-joining it, then installing the component. That got it to work. Then I just had to re-deploy solutions, re-activate features and re-configure my web.config.

;negative;According to the documentation in VB6 the Mid function returns a variant, but Mid$ returns a string and apparently this is more efficient. My questions are : What simple test can I use to discern the difference in performance ? I tried looking at simple app which did a few string operations, with , but there was no discernible difference. Is it worth worrying about?

;negative;FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.

Any suggestions would be great - Thanks!
;negative;This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.

;negative;This is totally abusive if you intentionally are using this with resources that are managed.
;neutral;I'm reasonably certain you can't shift focus to another tab. My understanding is this is done to somewhat limit pop ups and other malicious content from stealing the users focus.
;positive;Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed , I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!

;negative;Lastly, I don't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?
;positive;There is a such thing as a [sublime-project](@URL) file which you could check into Version control, but it seems like it could be overridden by Syntax specific settings per the [settings doc](@URL), and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit. [This blog](@URL) is also interesting and applicable.
;neutral;Comments should be not since we don't want this code to be shown to the user
;neutral;This is a slightly tricky question. I am using NSDateFormatter on the iPhone but I wanted to only show a standard date without the years component. But retain the users locale formatting for their date. I could easily override the formatting using But now the date is in my in en-nz format eg 12:01PM Wednesday July 7. So I have totally killed the locale for any other users around the world. I would like to say. Give me the correct localized date for this users region but omit the years component. Since the date is being displayed as string, I am tempted to just fromat the date and then remove the year component by just cutting this out of the string.
;neutral;If I understand your question correctly, the exception is because variable is not found inside the function. I'd suggest learning scoping rules in Python or read this excellent to-the-point chapter on the topic (or search for this topic on the Web!).The other thing I'd recommend is not to handle all exceptions as you've shown in your snippet. Here's why.The fixed code could look something like this:

;positive;"Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic ""anything can be chosen"" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses."

;negative;Vineet, what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that, take a step back and work out what else does it! I don't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing, but what mtwebster says is on the right track!

;positive;I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)
;neutral;"The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure (now as a string) in order to return that as JSON. So you are basically doing a double encode and the ""string"" gets encoded.So just pass in the data once: So on a small collection like this: Yo get a result like this: If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson ""dumps"" to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the Mongo objects deserialized, then further put into your ordered dict.But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements."
;positive;Programming Student here...trying to work on a project but I'm stuck. The project is trying to find the miles per gallon per trip then at the end outputting total miles and total gallons used and averaging miles per gallon How do I loop back up to the first question after the first set of questions has been asked. Also how will I average the trips...will I have to have a variable for each of the trips? I'm stuck, any help would be great!
;neutral;If your end goal is to add elements to your page, just manipulate the DOM directly. Don't use string concatenation to try to create HTML - what a pain! See how much more straightforward it is to just create your element, instead of the HTML that represents your element: Then, later when you put the element in your page, instead of setting the of the parent element, call :
;positive;"BTW - your article on ""the Math behind Transforms"" is an excellent read - very helpful indeed!"
;neutral;This is really a design / aesthetics question.
;negative;"Notably, the debugger shows the string *with* escape characters. When the string is printed in the console, the escape characters are not included. ""\""code\"""" vs. ""code"". This 100 character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying, say, a long JSON string and then immediately pasting that string (escape characters included) as a test string variable in your code."
;neutral;No worries, you should really try to learn css, it helps alot!
;neutral;I have a bunch of .NET frameworks installed on my machine. I know that with the Java JDK, I can use the 6.0 version to target 5.0 and earlier. Can I do something similar with the .NET framework - target 1.0 and 2.0 with the 3.0 framework?

;positive;That looks like a really excellent article, thanks for linking it. :) Where are you getting stuck? Do your logfiles show attempts to access the mobile content? If you add some logging to your browser detection, can you tell when the Opera Mini emulator is connecting vs when a desktop browser connects?
;neutral;You need to the file name as you build your URL. This will escape the '#' character, allowing the browser to interpret it appropriately. Proper encoding is very important for preventing attacks against your application, which can be devastating.
;negative;Probably has something to do with the unbearable bugginess of the Telerik RadControls suite
;negative;I'm trying to pull in tagged photos of the current logged in profile. Got a session ID but it appears it's an empty array. I'm aware this code is probably really awful, I'm new to PHP and just trying a few things.
;negative;ouch. I have a large table, and the row by row insert is very painful
;neutral;Not really, no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I didn't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of Controls and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail.
;negative;I am crying on the inside. And on the outside.
;neutral;anybody got an idea? build.xml
;positive;examples of input and output would be extremely helpful here.
;positive;I'm trying to make a link inside the fancybox single image title. I want it to redirect me to another fancybox window (witch is inline)... I have a script that makes the whole single image a link, but this targets my document title instead of the anchor title... I really hope someone will have a solution or a better idea on how to do it!! :) Thank you thank you thank yooou! :) btw: I have almost never worked with scripts.. In depth anyways...

;neutral;@USER Bennett: so which of the two alternatives did you choose? Did you contact Avast?
;neutral;LinqBridge only gives us Linq syntax on .NET 2.0. We still need an ORM.
;neutral;I just started practicing TDD in my projects. I'm developing a project now using php/zend/mysql and phpunit/dbunit for testing. I'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear, private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?
;positive;Is there anyway to control the styling of the scrollbars of a div tag? I am experiencing some contrast issues between IE7 and FireFox 3.5.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

;negative;I just got through this exact problem. What a pain! If you are running a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Windows, make sure that you set the execution policy for the 32-bit Powershell interface. I found my 32 bit executable here: The 32- and 64-bit Powershell environments are completely distinct so setting the execution policy in one has no effect on the other.

;negative;This was one area of C that the designers got terribly badly wrong!
;neutral;I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.
;neutral;I want to get the autoincrement id of an insert. is there a way to do it?

;negative;I am having trouble with adding text to the RichTextBox with tabs in it. I have code similar to this: And when I do this I can see tabs in paragraphs that start with '\t' but if I actually delete the tab then press the Tab key, the indentation is wrong. In fact it's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the TextRange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate '\t's generated by pressing the Tab key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?

;negative;I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in Android (for example, a bright yellow ). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an XML Layout file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes - such as ?
;positive;If you are really worried about performance, FirstOrDefault is O(n). Your second query is only going to execute if the first is null. You could try using .Any(predicate). First() lends itself to try { } catch which might be better for your situation. You don't really need to worry about performance optimization until it becomes an issue, though.
;positive;The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).
;negative;No, unless there's a relevant IE zero day. Obviously, this would be a huge abuse of user privacy (if you want their name, ask them!).
;neutral;I think the fact that you have SVN at the moment makes this question less obvious. A managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive. There are many options, and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes.

;neutral;if the 2 structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
;positive;I started to be thrilled only to find out that the example is ascii art!
;negative;I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

;neutral;I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong, weak, soft, phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.
;positive;I need to echo only selected lines from a .txt file using PHP. The txt file content looks like this: The previous working code was echoing every lines. I'm trying to get the same formating but only with the selected lines. For instance let say only lines: 3, 5, 8, 10. The second step would then be if the lines could be echoed in a different order than the initial one. If someone knows a simple way to do it, that would be excellent! Thanx in advance.

;neutral;You can use Projections in your Order
;negative;You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
;positive;I see... that's really great! Thanks!
;neutral;I don't think it's a matter of which language is better. In the .NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide.

;neutral;It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.

So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?

;negative;I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an E4X query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList, which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I'm not thinking of that XML and XMLList were designed to only have Object as a common type?

I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?

;neutral;This suffers from the race condition of having another process started between querying the system for it and returning to the caller saying it wasn't found. Using the mutex approach is one way around it.
;neutral;I have an IIS6 web server that is hosting two application pools. Occasionally, one of the w3wp processes will spike the CPU for a while, and both app pools seem to suffer the consequences.

;negative;I am new to Delphi (been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad Delphi is at handling dates and times. Maybe I think it's bad because I don't know how to use TDate and TTime properly, I don't know. Here is what is happening on me right now : That's not the exact code I use, everything is in variables and used in another context, but I think you can see the problem. Why is that calculation wrong? How am I suppose to work around this problem?

;neutral;IIRC, the max baud was effectively limited only by the H/W - I wrote my config to allow up to 1.3Mb, but I was targeting modems over RS-232 so 115K was the max that I needed, and likely the max that I ever will.

;negative;I had to do this once in Notes for a plugin I was developing. What I ended up doing was editing the Notes template in the designer, and then writing some LotusScript behind it that called a .NET class via a DLL. So when you clicked the button, it triggered the event in the LotusScript, and then called the DLL, and passed the item information to it. I should also note that it was a freakin' bear to figure out because Notes documentation is terrible.
;neutral;HXT, a library which is used for parsing XML, is a very good example for the usage of arrows (have a look how often the word occurs in the module names of this package!). You shall have a look on the great tutorial: @URL (The operator is defined in Control.Arrow).Thanks to the arrow syntax you have also a great tool to write complex computations in Haskell (it works as well for functions, monads and XML filters in HXT).
;neutral;I'm running socket.io/node.js on my EC2 auto-scaling array of servers. As soon as I have more than 1 server, there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers. This is where you'd normally use the redis store plugin that comes with socket.io. Unfortunately, I use MongoDB (not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module, but it absolutely killed my servers (huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 servers?

;negative;What's the easiest static (non-animating) 3d model format to load with Java? I used .obj in C++, but that's a pain to do in java. Is there anything better?
;negative;I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway. However, sometimes, like Neil says, you intentionally create dead code, for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I'd really, really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.

;negative;I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

;positive;I have a mobile web page with a table containing many rows. Each row has additional information. Ideally, when a user taps on each row, a new layer will display, covering the whole screen, that provides more information for each row. The layer can be closeable by tapping on the new layer itself. Is this something I can do with a to begin with? Or do these rows need to be divs instead? Please if someone could push me along, that would be excellent! Thanks.
;positive;I've been using a custom function for some time now to prevent clickjacking on certain sites. However, I've been surprised to find there's not a lot out there about how to do this 'idiomatically' using the various popular JavaScript frameworks. Are there users of jQuery, Dojo, YUI, and/or ExtJS that have used their framework to implement clickjacking protection? I'd love to see examples!

;neutral;I'm looking for experiences with deploying Crystal reports (the basic version, bundled with VS2008) into a production environment. Are there any restrictions? Does it limit the number of concurrent users? Other than downloading and installing the CRRedist2008_x86.msi on the production server, anything to worry about? (And judging from the comments here and other places, yes it would be better to find another solution, but unless there's something free that works with VS2008/IIS6, we're stuck with it for now).
;neutral;I maintain an application which, during the course of two years, has constantly required new hardware to be even usable, due to the amount of new users / new data inserted. However, justifying the investiment is sometimes very hard to do. I started to wonder - how can I establish the maximum number of users a web application currently suports? I thought of using JMeter scripts but they can get really nasty to implement when having to simulate file transfers and decison trees. What do you guys use?

;neutral;No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice. As this is a very painful task.have a good luck.

I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!

(This may require me to pull the data out and make it into a string collection ...) If anyone has any bright ideas, it would be very grateful!
;negative;I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.

From following the steps outlined, I can create polygon shapes around simple lines that do not cross themselves or have too tight curves, but as the lines I'm trying to buffer are squiggly swhirly hurricane tracks, it's really not good enough. I know there's a function in SQL Server 2008 that can do this, but I'm afraid that's currently a no go.

;negative;The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times! You just check whether the stream is in a good state. If not, you'll reset the stream and ignore the character. Search for question where this answered. Also, don't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and *always* throw something derived from `std::exception`: once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which isn't derived from `std::exception` in a program with a few million lines of code you'll find it extremely helpful to look at what `what()` returns!

The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running, we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate, and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available, update it accordingly. But still, I can't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar?

;positive;So I have a facebook page and a username /llamafont so I obviously want to keep that url. I have had the like button on sub pages (you save phrases and can like/share them on FB) since before I made the page on FB. When I have added the like button to my homepage for my base url, it shows 62k likes - GREAT! However on my facebook page i only have 107 - I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on FB? How can I make the 62K likes show up on my page in facebook? Do I need to add in all the meta og: stuff? Right now I only have og:image in there. Have I screwed it up for good? Or can I make FB recognize the likes somehow? Thanks in advance!

;negative;Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
