It supports audio and video devices It compiles on windows, linux, and a few others Also - I recommend using the SIP protocol (as opposed to H323) - You don't need to use Ekiga. Ekiga is a front-end to OPAL. You can take a look at the OPAL samples, and build up from those.

;neutral;Newbie question. I��m writing an ASP.Net MVC app in VB.Net and have been using NerdDinner as a sample (which is in C#). I��m stuck on the validation process specifically the code found in Models\Dinner.cs . I have tried converting it to VB.Net using but it chokes on the Yield statement which found in the GetRuleViolations method (see code below). So my question is how would you do the equivalent in VB.Net? namespace NerdDinner.Models { }
;negative;My first instinct is to branch normally (using p4 integrate), and then use an IDE or sed script to change the package names. But this makes future integration from the trunk extremely painful.
;positive;Strange - No one mentioned GEdit (Gnome) or OpenKomodo (Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux...). Both of them are great! OpenKomodo especially deals with tabs and spaces very well. And - it's free. Whee! When I need a lighter weight thingy, I just use GEdit. Download OpenKomodo here -

;neutral;First off, 16*16*3*3 = 2304 - quite modest really. At this size I'd be more worried about the confusion likely to be caused by a 4D array than the size it is taking! As others have said, if it fully populated, arrays are ok. If it has gaps, an ArrayList or similar would be better. If the Strings are just IDs, why not store an enum (or even Integers) instead of a string?

;positive;I loved the visualization of the race. Well done.
;negative;I've always been a bit frightened of Python. Is it not a relatively massive leap from an ingrained Web development mindset?
;positive;I just came across the following answer on another question: Hope that helps!
;negative;I built an xml-rpc server in Python using SimpleXMLRPCServer, according to the example in the Python documentation. I'm calling it from a Python client on the same machine. The body of the server function executes very fast on its own. But I find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow, taking one second per call. (Using xmlrpclib.) A speed-up technique I found on the web () didn't help. My connect URI is: I'm running Python 2.7 x64 on Windows 7, but it works the same for 32-bit Python 2.7.
;negative;I've changed the color scheme on sublime text 2 and I really hate the colors it changed to. So what is the name of the default settings? Because I want to change it back to the standard.
;neutral;Instead of logging to the console, log to a file and then track the file with a separate gui application. This keeps the console uncluttered and gives you a more persistent record of your log, which occasionally is extremely useful. There are various libraries which will do most of this for you, or you can keep it simple and just do it yourself.
;positive;If you are looking to load asynchronously javascript scripts, in the right order, I shall recommend you $script.js developed by the Twitter javascript lead dev It's really great!!
;neutral;For C/C++ on Windows you have (at least) two choices: Use the SerialPort class provided by .NET. Use the Win32 API. There is an dating back to 1995, and many free libraries and examples on the web to get you started. The .NET option will be much easier.
;positive;Awesome, thanks!

;negative;:-( This is a well-known CSS bug in IE6. AFAIK the workaround (it's horrible, shield your eyes) is to put an IFRAME underneath your menu so that the IFRAME obscures the improperly z-indexed SELECT. It's so very horrible. But JQuery is here to the rescue, as always:

;positive;I am pretty sure this can help! Cheers!
;positive;Furthermore if you need to look at the .NET/unmanaged stack just donwload and look at your w3wp.exe processes to examine memory and other stats without having to do a remote/local debugging (just look at the .NET Tab on the properties of the process). It will show all the .NET performance counters for that particular process. Awesome tool!

;negative;Ah - make me look lazy! (guilty)
;positive;First off I'm really loving all the things you can do with CouchDB. I'm coming from a lot of front end JavaScript and I use console.log() for lots of debugging and testing tasks. I'm wondering how to console.log or what a better way to debug might be in CouchDB. Any suggestions would be really awesome!

Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?"
;negative;Dotfuscator community edition is not good at all...
;positive;I used for a medium sized project, and loved it. It's incredibly feature-rich, has pretty good documentation, and an amazingly good support forum -- it's one of those ones where you ask a question, and a guy who works for the company that produces the software almost invariably answers it within a few hours. I used it with PHP and MySQL, but as far as I know it works with ASP.NET as well.
;negative;I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it, it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen, so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.

;neutral;I'm new to Flash but want to create a nice video for a product. It takes a long time to make a nice looking presentation , and I'm hoping for a jump start. Are there any good templates which are free on the internet where I can quickly change the text in ,for example, to make my video? I've tried looking in google, and there are too many websites, many of which look gimmicky. Any recommendations? (A video like this one - - would be amazing!)
;neutral;"Does string immutability work by statement, or by strings within a statement? For example, I understand that the following code will allocate two strings on the heap. ""hello"" will remain on the heap until garbage collected; and s now references ""hello world!"" on the heap. However, how many strings does the following line allocate on the heap...1 or 2? Also, is there a tool/way to verify the results?"

Right-click on a desktop icon and go to Properties, and look for the field marked ""Shortcut key""."
;neutral;The issue comes into play if you color a div, and set its opacity to make it transparent. If you then want to put text on this div, the text is transparent, and that isn't always desirable.
;positive;For all your keydown/keyup/keyboard needs, use the jQuery hotkeys plugin. Saw this a few months ago and it never fails to impress it. Follow the jump for the plugin demo ... It maps ALL keys on a keyboard including combos. Hope it helps!

;neutral;At work we use teraterm and realterm for checking serial data is correctly formatted. Also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port. Windows allows you access to the serial port via CreateFile. That gives you a handle and from there you can configure access.
;neutral;I have a need to explore VOIP integration into a .Net application. It would be incredibly helpful if the toolset was usable via ASP.Net (version 2.0 or higher), and provided the developer the option to allow interaction on the client either embedded within the web browser or external to the client web browser. It should be compatible at a minimum with Internet Explorer, but would be better if browser independence were an option.

;neutral;The class in Java has only two data members, a reference to an array and a size���which you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation, which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many, many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second, you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churn���but that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.

;neutral;In what context are you asking this question? Database type?
;neutral;I need to see the contents of the viewstate of an asp.net page. I looked for a viewstate decoder, found but it asks for the url of a page to get its viewstate. Since my viewstate is formed after a postback and comes as a result of an operation in an update panel, I cannot provide a url. I need to copy & paste the viewstate string and see what's inside.

Any help would be greatly appreciated:)
;neutral;Well, keep in mind that (in theory) you have the original code to help, as well as the text of the log messages. The only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names. In addition, many tools (Dotfuscator is one) create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name - this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from, but nowhere near impossible.

Is there a simple way (or a piece of software) that will let me find, for example, all the ""a"" tags that are within ""h3"" tags? Or all the ""spans"" that are within ""p"" tags? I want to modify some of these CSS rules but I'm afraid I'll break something hidden somewhere. Any advice?"
;neutral;Galileo came out the other day, and even though plugins under Eclipse are, IMO, just a little bit easier to deal with than , it would still be really awesome if there was a simple way for me to upgrade to the new version (and take my plugins with me). Any tips?
;negative;Is this visual studio specific or all c++ projects behave this way? Why??
;positive;I really liked which C++ however you can easily translate that to C# the author has a web site too.
;positive;"The following scripting is a custom addition to this Hover Fade Button; in my version it keeps the text of the button while changing the background images through css classes only. I have able to everything except when you click on another button you get two active buttons and so on. I like the buttons to hover {span.hover class}, click {span.active class}, and remove any other buttons with the span.active class and put back to regular state. Greatly appreciate a solution!"
;negative;Why is it a pain for the time to be accurate? The OS keeps it synchronized for you automatically using NTP on any operating system made in the last 10 years...
;neutral;@USER what do you mean by that, exactly?
;positive;+1. Great question! Now, I have no clue about the answer, but I'll stay tuned.
;neutral;How to check a popup menu item?
;neutral;Lots of people talk about writing tests for their code before they start writing their code. This practice is generally known as Test Driven Development or TDD for short. What benefits do I gain from writing software this way? How do I get started with this practice?
;negative;I got iPhone app. When i start it, i see black view. This black view is shown before app's first view. And it looks really awful. Can i set here preview picture?
;positive;Wow great idea! Try to do it with inlineEditSupport. @URL
;positive;If you package this code in a class library like I did, you'll have to change the access modifier from `internal` to `public`. Excellent code, saved me a lot of time.
;positive;Excellent!!! This is exactly what I am looking for!
;neutral;this is a bisection root method
;positive;Excellent! It works, thank you very much.
;positive;Craig Shoemaker has made an excellent show on asp.net caching:
;negative;I'm using this practice to add comments using AJAX , by sending the data to an ASP.NET Handler which collect the information and then insert the comment, but I am afraid that any one could use it , am I wrong !?
;positive;Nice! I love the video software! lol. Had to download it. Anyway, I fixed the Open Modal, I didn't fix teh fixed modal. I'll get back to you in a minute
;negative;Why would you want to do that?? No offense, but that is the most annoying and useless 'feature' ever!
;positive;There is a guy who made the exact same observation as you, and he has published a blog post with a simple working example of a Quartz.net Console application. I used it with great success yesterday!
;positive;Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.
;negative;Oh the horror! Try `page.php#iframe_id` as the target.
;neutral;I solved this. That filter in web.xml must be first filter in file.
;positive;Excellent! You should document that as an answer and accept it so many more people can solve this with a google search on 'single line of text' :)
;neutral;But why the custom `WorkMethod` delegate instead of `Action`?
;positive;There's a discussion related to this and one . Essentially, you use Invoke to accomplish it. Best of luck!
;positive;AFAIK, the creator of DelphiCodeToDoc is actually still actively working on it. Have you tried sending him an e-mail? In my experience, he's very helpful!
;negative;I was wondering if there was somewhere I could get some starter kit / theme sample for ASP.NET. I am not a designer, but I need to build a prototype for a project, and if I do it myself it'll certainly be awful Do you know where I could find that (ASP.NET specific)?
;positive;Proxy (among many other meanings) is a **design pattern** -- see [wikipedia](@URL) for excellent coverage (not intensely C++ specific, of course).
;neutral;Note you can also export to TXT (as you said you need to in your answer further down, jazzrai).
;positive;"loved your line NSIndexPath *indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:1];. +1 for you ;)"
;neutral;No worries, just a tip for future reference.
;neutral;"is excellent for scripts; is standard for classes. As Ben says, think of it as ""Object"" -- but it is much cooler in that it does not constrain you to the Object methods. This has neat implications with respect to imports. e.g. In this snippet I have to import FileChannel e.g. But here I can just 'wing it' as long as everything is on the classpath"
;positive;Devexpress have a good one: The RangeTrackBarControl control extends the functionality provided by the TrackBarControl enabling end-users to select a range of values. Two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values: you can get them free from: hope this helps!
;positive;Excellent workaround..!
;positive;A List Apart is a great site, I recommend it heavily! I've also used this article in the past: @URL
;positive;Great question!
;negative;@USER Don't bother, he's much too stupid and heinous to be worth helping (see his comments on my answer, it's a model of how to get help).
;neutral;jQuery chokes on certain JSON keys. I was sending this JSON snippet in PHP: Renaming the 'result' key to something else works. I would guess this is a reserved word collision of some kind, and could be a bug in jQuery (1.4.2).
;neutral;I had similar issue. This article explains why and how to solve it:
;negative;@USER Everything else works. All my apps, including VS, and my other dev projects. So I'm really afraid to break all of them.
;neutral;Consider this HTML: On all browsers but Firefox/Mac, it renders correctly, i.e bold and non-bold text are on the same baseline. On Firefox/Mac, there is a 1px baseline difference between the bold and non-bold texts. See below for screenshot. Left is Safari 3.2.3, right is Firefox 3.0.10. Is there any way to fix this e.g with some CSS, other than to go quietly cry in the corner and use Arial (which I'd not want to do ��� I'd stay with Helvetica Neue if I could).

;positive;Nick Rigby wrote an excellent article for A List Apart titled Uses fieldset, legend, label. Highly semantic.
;positive;I love the way you assimilated another answer!
;positive;I am not familiar with the instance manager, but I have used on several systems (including a remotely hosted server) with great success. It supports MySQL 5.0 and 4.1.
;positive;I agree. It's clear that you are on the threshold of either using a library or writing your own. Go get jQuery and just use it as you see fit in your project, starting with this. Here's to happier days!
;neutral;In WPF, how would I apply multiple styles to a ? For instance, I have a control which already has a style. I also have a separate style which I would like to add to it without blowing away the first one. The styles have different TargetTypes, so I can't just extend one with the other.
;positive;"Library independent, very nice! Although I prefer the declaration more ""class"" like: `function MyClassName() {};`"
;positive;works excellent!! thanks a lot guys!!!
;positive;EXCELLENT! works like magic, just what i needed
;positive;Gotta love stackoverflow!
;positive;See also this excellent answer: @URL
;positive;Great! Thank you.
;positive;Somewhere on the web there is a blog post which is just a lot of scrum boards. It is really good to see how other people do it. Maybe someone can find it for us :) I think this looks like a pretty comprehensive way of doing things!
;neutral;If you're really worried about that, make an NSTimer that fires in say 5 seconds, and send traffic when it fires. Invalidate the timer when your view disappears.
;negative;Your code sample strikes me as a very strange design and an abuse of what properties are intended for. Why not just an instance method : Your property also returns if the key does not exist, but claims to return an , nor a .
;neutral;and XPath... XQuery is more what you are looking for if a SQL structure is desirable.
;positive;To add on to mwigdahl's excellent post: [here](@URL)'s a link that explains how to achieve FLL for g++ -- this may give you some additional insights.
;neutral;We make heavy use of Velocity in our web application. While it is easy to debug the Java side of things and ensure the Velocity Context is populated correctly, it would be extremely valuable to be able to step through the parsing of the VTL on the merge step, set breakpoints, etc. Are there any tools or IDEs/IDE plugins that would make this kind of thing possible with VTL (Velocity Template Language)?
;positive;Excellent points, David. I think in Corey's case, he doesn't have an Access front end so our posts are for general knowledge that applies to most Access developers.
;positive;Wrote it down for you, hope it works as you expected!
;positive;I think that solution is now ready. Here's the code: David Wasser you are extremely helpful, thanks!
;positive;"Span? That reminds me of a Monty Python... ""Span, lovely Span, wonderful Span!"""
;positive;Wow!! The question sounds like question for working in the kitchen. I am amazed the names used for the tools :)
;positive;@USER Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar. So I could do `int len = [self.stringProperty length]` as you'd expect inside the class, AND I can also do `int len = [stringProperty length]` as well, without using the accessor method, just directly using the ivar (which the compiler has synthesized for me, along with setter+getter). It's really fantastic!
;positive;Jeo Clecko's SQL for smarties is excellent.
;neutral;I think Jon probably cleared the code for you.
;positive;Great question!! I'm hoping to use something like migrations with Django too.
;neutral;"Not sure what you mean by ""child form"". Perhaps it's a button on a panel on a form? Or is it a MDI thing? Or is the child form a dialog box?"
;neutral;How would you manage the lifecycle and automated build process when some of the projects (C# .csproj projects) are part of the actual build system? Example: A.csproj is a project that uses MSBuild tasks that are implemented in BuildEnv.csproj. Both projects are part of the same product (meaning, BuildEnv.csproj frequently changes as the product is being developed and not a 3rd party that is rarely updated)
;positive;As mentioned above, some of the fundamental Object Oriented Design principles are OCP, LSP, DIP and ISP. An excellent overview of these by Robert C. Martin (of Object Mentor) is available here:
;negative;@USER I'm really not sure what you mean, I'm afraid.
;positive;This worked great for me, thanks!
;negative;I tend to have just 1 file, but don't upload the web.config when I update the site - maybe this is bad practice, but I think its what Microsoft intend you to do. Can be a bit of a pain though if you (or a new team member) accidentlly upload it...
;positive;Oh! Excellent!! Worked like a charm!
;neutral;We're looking at Drools/Guvnor, possibly integrated with jBPM (as in this ), to add a workflow engine to our Spring/Java EE app, but we're still in the very early phases of trying it out.
;neutral;How to make it work,an example?
;positive;"Glad to see I'm not the only one who got that! The free book is actually really exciting; it will definitely motivate you to do peer code review."
;positive;@USER My pleasure! :)
;neutral;I have a silverlight control (View) which displays a list of items in a specified property of the datacontext (viewmodel). What I need is for the scrollviewer in my control to scroll to the top or bottom depending on where the latest item has been added to the list. (It'll always be either the beginning or the end of the list, I don't need to worry about middle of list insertions.) In WPF i'd just use the DataContextChanged event to start listening to the viewmodel, but in silverlight that event is internal. Any ideas on how to tackle this?
;positive;+1 I haven't such items in the right-click menu, but Repo Browser way works great, thanks!
;positive;Sweet :) Happy hacking!
;negative;Very annoying! If you are desperate to get this working you could force Chrome to redraw the element (on window resize, maybe?):

;neutral;"here is the magic DataFormatString=""{0:c0} this will remove the decimal places"
;neutral;I ran this in a rails console:
;positive;I'd like to be able to see what registry keys are used for. A book on the registry would be fine as well. Info on Windows Vista changes would be great!
;positive;Sky, it sounds like you can maintain *complete* test coverage for an exception. Excellent work! Maybe someday I'll learn how to do that.
;neutral;have you actually tried your solution?
;positive;I would checkout . It has great reviews on Amazon and the Head First book series are really terrific and engaging.
;neutral;I'm in the process of implementing a binary tree in C++. Traditionally, I'd have a pointer to left and a pointer to right, but manual memory management typically ends in tears. Which leads me to my question... Are data structures an appropriate place to use shared_ptr?
;negative;This is one thing that I really hate within development is forms. Below is my code and what I am trying to do is align the inputs with the labels . Is there a rule that you use to help remember when coding forms? CSS: HTML:
;positive;numpy is awesome :P
;positive;Excellent! Will try it soon. But it should work i guess.
;negative;@USER I would like to use boost more, but its synergy with C++11 is terrible, and there are some rather... _curious_ design decisions (Iostreams requires Devices to be copyable, but makes streams noncopyable... oh, and also nonmovable - at least in the implementation I'm using, maybe they fixed it?).
;neutral;"""I understand that server-side validation is an absolute must to prevent malicious users (or simply users who choose to disable javascript) from bypassing client-side validation"""
;positive;I understand you need to know the sizes conversion. Sometimes I use this tool: And I found an excellent article about the screen sizes and densities: I hope it will be useful for you!
;neutral;what about 3rd question?( When is it appropriate and when not?)
;negative;What a sad answer!! Maybe I can just don't install it, and leave the hell to user.
;neutral;What platform? What languages will you accept?
;negative;I had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround. When I was done I didn't really hate it though, because it allowed me to free-up the UIPageViewController and all of it's child UIPageViewControllers and all of their resources when the user wasn't actively using the tab.
;positive;Awesome, that did it! Thanks David!
;positive;You should . It has a lot of good packages. I found these packages to help you with zip files for example: The NPM registry is really amazing :)
;neutral;I have this jQuery code: why $(this) doesn't work in a setTimeout method?
;neutral;Doesn't the CLR automatically release any unreleased mutexes when the application terminates anyway?
;negative;Based mostly on , but also , and my own experience, I don't think it's possible without a lot of ugliness, pain or without converting your LINQ to SQL code generation over to (not appealing, IMO).
;neutral;@USER from my personal experience, somehow I always get faster and more reliable results when I'm using tables. But every time I did that, I feel guilty.
;negative;For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
;neutral;Are you upsizing or downsizing?
;positive;Ahh, I didn't know that the wsdl command line utility could generate one file for many asmx.... thats awesome! I'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great, thank!
;negative;So, I'm trying to make a 3D grapher for a class. Right now I'm working on understanding OpenGL and I'm failing horribly. I want to move the camera, but I can't at all, whatsoever. Why doesn't this work?
;positive;Excellent news, good stuff!
;neutral;instanceof is very efficient, so your performance is unlikely to suffer. However, using lots of instanceof suggests a design issue. If you can use xClass == String.class, this is faster. Note: you don't need instanceof for final classes.
;positive;+1 That looks like an excellent resource!
;positive;Excellent answer, thanks!
;positive;"Almost works. You have to seek to one less then write a byte, otherwise you still end up with a 0B file. Still very helpful, thanks! Correct Syntax too. If you want to edit, the extra line you need is OutFile.WriteByte(0);"
;neutral;You can try out , it allow prototyping with different styles, what's more, it can make interactive prototype and run it in browser.
;negative;Very painful and doesn't work with inputs from the user.
;positive;Thanks to the two of you that answered. What I ended up doing (in case anyone else is interested!) was processing the openid login like normal, but NOT saving the new user to the database. Instead, I stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in. Hope this helps!
;positive;I'm sure lots of people will say this by the time I've typed this but... I know it's not PHP but we're finding just the job for this kind of thing. It really is an excellent piece of software.
;neutral;Why do you need to have the encryption of the passphrase reversible? That's not generally desirable.
;positive;If you handle the RowDataBound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in VB rather than C#. Good Luck!
;positive;You...are...awesome!!!
;negative;"Usability notes: Personally I hate when sites put the ""forgot password"" or ""forgot username"" or ""help"" links inbetween the password field, and the Login button. As a keyboard user, I shouldn't have to TAB over them to get to the submit button. Better yet, also capture the Enter keypress on the password field so that I can auto-submit with the Enter key."
;positive;"for flow control Steven; the question seems to be about whether this pattern should be used, which seems to be rather subjective based on the answers, but it's an excellent question for thought."

;neutral;I couldnt extract using `cabextract`, used `unrar` instead. `unrar e filaname.part01.exe` worked
;positive;You've got to start with a custom instance of . We'd prefer to implement the simpler , but in this scenario we need access to the underlying . Then, to wire it up in the iBATIS config: Hope this helps!
;positive;Excellent! I got it working with your help.
;positive;Although that text editor test isn't 15 minutes, it sounds like an excellent test. It's more like what you would do in real life compared to writing algorithms: maintain code that someone else might have made.
;neutral;For those, who use ShinobiCharts.framework: creating a category on Shinobi classes causes such error. As a workaround, you can replace categories with inheritance (this may be very painful).

;neutral;This is a solution to a local problem, not an obvious/general purpose System.String operation. A utility class might be in order, but it would be extension method abuse to use an extension method here.
;neutral;My experience - If you know the requirements of a project well and if they can be easily achieved with standard ssis components with a minimum of scripting, then SSIS might be the way to go. Otherwise, its a pain.

;negative;Terrible! Why do you post all that code? Three asynctasks. Do we have to dig through all that? You should only post the relevant code.
;negative;I wouldn't worry about that in pure Flash. I don't believe that is the mental model the Flash Engineers used (Flex, absolutely, worry).
;positive;Already answered to wrap it but here's an . Good luck!
;positive;You should really check out . I evaluated it quite a bit last year and really liked it although in the end we deployed TFS2008 and so we're using TeamBuild to get a lot of the integration goodness. But really FinalBuilder had TONs of prebuilt build activities, great support for lots of environments and tools, and a nice IDE for designing it all.
;positive;I'm using some modifications to Glenn Berry's excellent DMV queries! However, I would like to add to the resultset the 'last server restart', or to be more specific, the date/time the statistics for (all, the specific) DMV was reset. Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics, I want to make absolutely sure the date/time is accurate and shown. Question: How can you get the most accurate date/time of when a/all DMV statistic was reset? Thanks! -D
;neutral;What are some effective strategies for preventing the use of my proprietary images? I'm talking about saving them, direct linking to them etc... Presently I have a watermark on the image, but I'd rather not. .NET platform preferred, but if there's a strategy that's on another platform that integrates with my existing application that'd be a bonus.

;negative;Our QA team uses HP Quality Center for defect tracking, test plans, etc. The dev team really detests Quality Center and wants to use JIRA for internal task tracking. Can these two systems work seamlessly together? I have worked on projects where 2 teams used separate issue-tracking systems and keeping them in sync was a major headache. Anyone have real-world experience integrating Quality Center and JIRA?

;positive;(Great question!)
;positive;Thanks for all your input. I came across this extension and it worked REALLY GREAT for me!
;negative;Combining NH attributes and some FNH automapping stuff looks very scary. I do not understand it at all but IMO classic ClassMap is much more transparent. You must pay with more key strokes but your head hurts less:). and this code deletes connection and endpoint as well from database:

;positive;Great chart! Good find.
;negative;Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.
;neutral;Cant you just use namespaces?
;neutral;The last thing you should be worrying about is how fast one of these is. There is no way that checking a string for being an integer is going to be a bottleneck in your code.
;positive;Excellent, thanks for reporting back!

;negative;I completely agree with you on that subject. In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design, procedural code, no encapsulation, production code littered with test code, interfaces everywhere, hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.

In essence on the service call, I want to retrieve the provider type (a custom enum in my code) and the connection string from the web.config.

How do I override this. It is extremely frustrating. As you can see from the snippet the setting AND the connection string name exist, but the code never picks it up.

;neutral;I think the first approach is OK, but you have to be sure to always have branch B updated with the new changes introduced in branch A. Otherwise if you don't keep them synchronized, these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain. SVN merge's are ok if you do them early and often.
;positive;that is what I am doing now. I find this a more practical solution and I see there are other people doing the same. Well, great!

;positive;In the absence of tuples, they're sometimes the cleanest way to do things. I generally hate them, though. F# has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them. Rather than making me deal with parameters, it treats them as methods that return tuples instead. The various methods end up returning two element tuples: It's quite handy, and doesn't make me feel dirty.

;negative;Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience, the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less.

At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?

;neutral;Maybe it helps someone else: you can use www.browserstack.com to access VMs with different browser versions directly from the dev machine. (i have no affiliation with the company)
;positive;I would say yes, it was Anders Heljsberg's intent to make the observer pattern a first-class language feature with events in C#, based on his experience with Delphi. Anders makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on .
;positive;Great links, thanks for your work!
;neutral;Can I by any means get the elapsed time of the storyboard in Silverlight?
;negative;Triggering quirks mode is a terrible, terrible, terrible thing. In quirks mode, jQuery is forced to use alternative methods to interact with the DOM and is almost definitely the cause of your speed issues in IE.
;negative;In theory, you could apply that philosophy to every single question on SO. But it would be terribly boring to do so.
;negative;By the way, as a side note, you should be using `using(Stream s = ...)` statement instead of manually writing a try {} finally {} block which might be error prone and also a pain to write.
;neutral;Why wouldn't you use a staticmethod?
;positive;I really enjoy programming in Mathematica, and hence was looking for solutions in it.
;neutral;Follow the answer and the link in it.
;positive;In addition to the great LINQ-implementation of Dean, I had fun wrapping the code into an extension for DependencyObjects: This makes it extremely nice considering reuseablity.
;negative;I am planning to use community sever for one of our projects, i used it in the past but we had a lot of problems customizing it and understanding how things work, im affraid to get into that again, and i would like to add some things to it but i dont know how flexible it is.
;neutral;Multiply by 100 and then convert to an int.
;positive;Thanks, I downloaded FileSeek and it worked great!
;neutral;Out of the box, in MS Reporting Services, the image element does not allow for the centering of the image itself, when the dimensions are unknown at design time. In other words, the image (if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface) will be anchored to the top left corner, not in the center. My report will know the URL of the image at runtime, and I need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer.
;positive;I really like Kate, and since it's a KPart, other KDE programs use it as the editor, so it's goodness everywhere! (why is everybody else assuming you use windows?)
;negative;Android camera stuff is extremely frustrating, I understand that. Make sure to read through all of the and check out this code below referenced from :
;positive;Great manual, helped immensely!
;neutral;I'm not sure why this is marked down. AutoHotkey is an excellent solution when you need to do something that you just can't do using an existing API. It has many safeguards that can be used to ensure that the correct program is targeted. There are many possibilities. The answer that is marked as an answer, isn't an answer. It just an obvious statement which is the reason the question was asked in the first place. I would suggest anyone marking down this answer should first look into AutoHotkey and learn what it can do. It should be built into windows.
;neutral;I want a text file containing links to the Wikipedia articles listed , one link per line. I could do it manually but that would be very painful. How can I automate this task?
;negative;This isn't really pythonic so much as tortured, but here's a short version (with meaningless 1-character variable names, no less!)
;positive;this is gorgeous!
;negative;I'm working on a webservice + AJAX interface, and I'm worried about authentication. This moment I'm passing username and password to the webservice as arguments, but I fear that this approach is highly insecure. I was told that ssl could solve my problem, but I want more alternatives. My webservice is written in php and my interface is in php + AJAX. The webservice receives arguments from POST or GET and retreives xml (in a future maybe I'll use JSON)
;neutral;Simply use . It will point out all your memory allocation mistakes with excruciating preciseness.
;positive;"I really love the ""one model in - one model out"" idea of Fubu MVC. A controller would look something like this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor. This makes the controller very easy to test. So my question is: How would you go about tweaking asp.net mvc to allow this simplicity in the controllers ?"
;positive;i really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user control, and make sub folder images, css, and put local resource file, so the whole thing is contained in one folder, and that makes it really efficient for me (management wise). but the bugger is you cant get intellisence like global resource, so is it possible in any way ?
;negative;this is a disgustingly horrible hack, but it might get the job done:
;positive;Thank you very much, this is really interesting stuff!
;neutral;@USER What makes your elements size changed?
;neutral;With PHP you can use method to run you .sh file. Pass the name of the script via post data, but be very very careful, user can modify the param to execute malicious code on your machine!
;positive;Jim did a great job!
;neutral;Take a look at . Bear in mind that running both side by side is not supported by Microsoft () and there's no guarantee that they will work absolutely fine side by side - a Windows Update could easily break something and sometimes people find conditional comments don't work properly amongst other things. All I can suggest is you give it a go and see how you get on.
;neutral;@USER Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.
;positive;I've had great success with 's Auto-Suggest implementation. It includes PHP examples too.
;positive;"@USER no worries, you have to start somewhere ;) good luck in the future!"
;positive;I love Raymond Chen's blog! I would have considered putting this in the suggestion box if it wasn't closed.
;neutral;"If you give each key a unique name, e.g. ""invoices.invoice_id"" instead of ""invoices.id"", then you can use the ""natural join"" and ""using"" operators with no worries. E.g. instead of SQL is verbose enough without making it more verbose."
;positive;Your library should be named , with symlinks of and both pointing to that. The library should be created using in the linker command line (or on the gcc command line). Hope that helps!
;positive;Awesome! You have no idea how long I've been trying to find this!
;negative;There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage, and of course no audio, but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course, on Windows platforms, you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well, without ever touching flash.
;negative;Is there a simple library out there for Java in a Maven repository that will give me simple, one-liner hash methods for the popular hash functions such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512? I'd really hate to have to reinvent the wheel to do this.
;positive;"You may be looking for a solution similar to Josh Smith's """". In his article, he presents the following: And then uses the multi-value converters as follows: Hope this helps!"
;positive;Holy (*&^. I just looked at the jquery solution: add a hidden element to the DOM containing every conceivable tag and then reverse engineer the geometry conventions. The web is truly amazing place!
;positive;Great question!
;positive;"Hehe this is nothing compared to some other little adventures I had with them ^_^"" ... I love them *^o^*!!"
;positive;Creating custom types can be done in PowerShell. Kirk Munro actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly. The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types. The book is excellent all around, so I really recommend it. If you are just looking for a quick way to do the above, you could create a function to create the custom object like
;positive;I agree. Excellent update. +1.
;positive;@USER It's not compilable java. It's used to navigate the code in eclipse/idea and is excellent if you have a large code base with lots of long class names.
;positive;Awesome! Thank you!
;neutral;I have an image and on it are logos (it's a map), I want to have a little box popup with information about that logo's location when the user moves their mouse over said logo. Can I do this without using a javascript framework and if so, are there any small libraries/scripts that will let me do such a thing?
;neutral;Anyone know a quick easy way to migrate a SQLite3 database to MySQL?
;neutral;ctypes is in the python standard library, swig and boost are not. Swig and boost rely on extension modules and are therefore tied to python minor versions which indepentent shared objects are not. building a swig or boost wrappers can be a pain, ctypes makes no build requirements.
;neutral;One thought might to have another separate process count the number of rows in the table where the insert is being done to determine what percentage of them are there already. This of course would require that you know the total in the end. This would probably only be okay if this you're not too worried about server load.
;neutral;You should use template engine. See ejs, or jade for example. If you are using Express nodejs framework, then it is very comfortable to use jade. There is also template engine called Bliss which is like Razor Engine in ASP.NET
;negative;Since I am completely useless at regex and this has been bugging me for the past half an hour, I think I'll post this up here as it's probably quite simple. In PHP I need to extract what's between the tags example:
;positive;Oh, wow, awesome! Thanks! (this question needs to have a answer, any volunteer?)
;positive;from a really geeky perspective, that is really cool!
;positive;"I don't know the answer to this question, but the book ""Understanding the Linux Kernel"" has a lot of good information on this type of stuff. It's a really great book, anyone doing kernel work should read it."
;neutral;"Seems like a duplicate question. Please see excellent answer for ""[Should Usings be inside or outside the namespace][1]"" [1]: @URL"

;positive;How would I go about using Stephen Celis' fantastic SCListener singleton? () I would like to start with something incredibly simple.. like display the input volume in a textview or just display a UIImage when the listener detects something. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
;positive;To summarise the link provided by Codeslayer (in case the page url changes)... Change the sql file templates to ANSI encoding by opening with notepad and then saving it as an ANSI file. You can do the same for files already created. \Common7\Tools\Templates\Database Project Items You've just made our DBA's very happy!
;negative;Since you're testing legacy code I'm assuming you can't refactor said code to have less dependencies (e.g. by using the ) That leaves you with little options I'm afraid. Every header that was included for a type or function will need a mock object for that type or function for everything to compile, there's little you can do...
;neutral;I have not figured out how to set the font yet, but I did find an excellent example of how to make the colors on alternating rows of the list to vary in color: @URL (It was different in AS2 - just needed one line. Now you need one line plus three whole classes.)
;neutral;will give you what you want, I think.
;negative;well.. taht's... sad =(
;positive;Wow! It is really great answer! So helpful! Thank you very much!
;positive;If it has a lot of cup holders, that'd be awesome, too!
;positive;Have you actually implemented this successfully? It sounds like a great solution!
;positive;Thanks all for the great responses!! All of these worked
;negative;fails horribly for, e.g., `domain = '@URL'`
;neutral;Events firing are delegate invocations, which are a But dealing with interfaces for subscriber/publisher/observer/observable scenario is more painful that using events.
;positive;(Python Remote Objects) is fairly clever if all your server/clients are going to be in Python. I use alot though since I'm communicating with hosts that are not always Python. XMPP lends itself to being extended fairly easily too. There is an excellent XMPP library for python called which is reasonably up to date and has no dependancy on Twisted.
;positive;Awesome! Thanks.
;positive;Excellent recipe!
;neutral;So I came up with what is undoubtedly an extremely ugly solution: I took the Response JS data attributes out of the body tag, and used the Response.create method instead. Then someone suggested I make the plugin calls a function, then call the function after creating the Response data attributes. I have no idea why it works, but it does.
;neutral;Consider using Ragel That's what powers mongrel under the hood. Parsing a string multiple times is going to slow things down dramatically.
;negative;Now that's a lousy, lousy way to answer a question. Where do you do this?
;positive;No worries, we were all new once!
;positive;ROT13. It's super efficient too!
;positive;Very nice work!
;neutral;Why don't you just run multiple instances, one per document?
;positive;I have a small application that I am building a Chat application into, so far I have the functionality to post messages! I don't need a login as there will only be a small number of users and I will use their windows username for identification. Has anyone done anything similiar? What else do I need to add? It doesn't need to be all singing and dancing as it is just for use within a small development team. Any ideas would be great! Thanks
;negative;I have a web page that renders the same in IE7, Firefox, and Safari - except when printing. IE7 appears to allocate too much space for borders when printing. In the example below, the box heights plus borders should add up to the same height in the 2 columns. I set the borders to 10px to exaggerate the problem. I hate CSS hacks, and so far I've been able to create my pages without them. Any suggestions?
;negative;There are major oversights in the CSS spec related to basic page layout. Sad. It is about as well thought out as HTML.
;positive;Don't forget about ! JSON seems to have better support though. For example, the library has excellent built-in JSON functions.
;positive;I need to transform this : into this : I tried to use wrapAll with jquery, something like that : Any suggestions would be really appreciated :) Thank you very much !
;neutral;You don't need to tag your title, that is what the tags are for.
;positive;@USER Excellent! Please consider [accepting this answer](@URL), then :-)
;positive;but stackoverflow is awesome!
;neutral;No, that article still DOES work in the latest Chrome and Firefox as of February 24th, 2013
;negative;Not an answer, but why on earth would you want 32,000 items in a combo box? That is a terrible way to store that much data.
;positive;We ended up rolling our own, similar to Figaro but with support for nested values, multiple files, and placeholders. It's pretty awesome: !
;positive;See here: I tried retrotranslator from 1.6 to 1.4.2 and it works pretty well!
;negative;IF another person says NUnit, I am gonna puke! Where TF did you people learn to read?
;positive;"Excellent! It works like this: [code]extern ""C"" {"
;negative;"Basically, the doctype determines how crazy IE is going to be. If you don't set it to XHTML, or ""strict"" you'll be living in a world of hurt when it comes to IE (even if you set it, you'll still be hating on IE, but it does make it a lot better)."
;positive;@USER +1 Excellent and complete answer!
;negative;I understand its not a desirable circumstance, however if I NEEDED to have some kind of HTML within JSON tags, e.g.: is this possible to do in Python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand? It will be a string initially so I was thinking about writing a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing, but I just want to make sure there isn't an easier way.
;negative;I have a window using a WPF ListView/GridView bound to an ObservableCollection. The performance is utterly horrific. The application chokes trying to load 300-400 items and CPU usage spikes each time an item is added/removed/modified. Profiling doesn't reveal anything obvious. Anyone have any suggestions?
;positive;@USER no worries!!
;positive;totally awesome
;positive;I have a gridview with rows that can be edited, inserted etc. I wrapped it in an updatepanel to give it an AJAX effect and update the system without reloading the page. I recently got into using jQuery and webservices for my AJAX calls and I absolutely love how it works and how fast it is. I would like to know if it is possible, and if so then how, to update my gridview using jQuery AJAX methods.
;negative;The documentation for the minitest-ci gem (seemingly the only option for producing test results for a CI tool such as Jenkins) has the extremely annoying habit of not preserving the results of when invoked as - the test results from running minitest:models are deleted prior to running the rest of the tests. minitest-ci's barely-extant documentation claims adding this to test_helper.rb will disable the troublesome auto-clean behavior, but it doesn't: Has anyone out there managed to get minitest-ci to preserve all the test result files? I'm reaching wits' end here.
;positive;is probably not what you want, but is still really excellent.
;neutral;Don't mess with Ext.Loader unless you feel extremely masochistic. The Land of Big Pain lies down that road.
;positive;I've decided to use the FreeFileSync tool from There is some effort to configure it to ignore some files and folders, but the tool provides nice filter possibilities. Configuring these filters can be very time consuming but they're working fine :) Thank's for all your help!

;neutral;How do i scroll to a panel within an updatepanel after i load the content
;positive;thanks so much! excellent insight!
;positive;Excellent approach!
;negative;This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
;neutral;While this is excellent advice, as other answers state, there is a more nuanced answer in the case of an immutable, safely published map instance. But you should do that only if You Know What You're Doing.
;negative;I'm using vbscript, all that does is reverse the setting of checkbox.checked, whichever way it is. As an aside, vbscript is awful to work in.
;negative;Right ... if only I was using SQL server.. Informix unfortunately :( :( :(
;positive;thank you so much as long you replace char(0) with 0 in the above this works great!
;positive;I have a query that is simply selecting from 3 tables. select from the comments table for all comments on an article select from UserID table to find what kind of user it is IF the user is one type, search one table...ELSE search another table for the final info. How would I go about this? I'm a little new at MySQL stuff, so i totally appreciate your patience! PS - let me know if this isnt clear... Thanks!
;positive;"Check out It does the ""THIS IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL APP"" napkin view very well and is easy to use. Has a full featured you can try out online and as an added bonus you can email your XML to your client and they can tweak it and play with it and email it back to you without having to have a license."
;negative;This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project, when I'm working normally, the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown. This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running. Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.
;positive;Pretty outstanding book: Gives you a good overview of the architecture of SSAS, as well as the query language MDX, and administrative/maintenance overview. A good primer for a developer OR a system administrator.
;positive;Awesome!! Thanks :)
;positive;Excellent! This is exactly what I needed. Thanks!
;neutral;@USER Marshalled python objects are tied to a specific version of Python (from [the marshal docs](@URL)), but not being tied to a specific version of Perforce is definitely a bonus to using the command line.
;positive;This is really simple and works great! I did a javascript test: @URL
;negative;I have no answer, but I'll 2nd the sentiment about the documentation quality for OpenSSL... I'm working with it now also (just starting), and it's horrible trying to find examples or documents for anything beyond simple operations... I feel your pain.
;negative;@USER very sad:(
;neutral;My problem with Boost (here, and elsewhere) is that you can often get on without it (in this case with C++11 or before C++11 [with a function](@URL)). Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.
;neutral;J# was, from the very beginning, a migration language. There were lots of devs who had used VJ++, Microsoft's version of Java. When .NET came out, the company provided J# as a way to move those devs and their code, unchanged, to .NET. Today, starting out, there is no reason to use J#.
;neutral;Just a note. You don't need a plugin to do this in Firefox. It's built in.
;positive;Excellent tutorial!
;negative;this link is dead :(
;neutral;Url points to a tesco advert
;positive;is a really great option for git. Most of the free, public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license (and, possibly, your documentation). That's potentially a different thing that you're talking about (backups). For just backups, you may want to try a for-pay service or even something like .
;neutral;VirtualBox also has API's for automating their VM's.
;positive;That migration doc was essential for me, great link!
;neutral;I am looking for a very fast way to filter down a collection in C#. I am currently using generic List<object> collections, but am open to using other structures if they perform better. Currently, I am just creating a new List<object> and looping thru the original list. If the filtering criteria matches, I put a copy into the new list. Is there a better way to do this? Is there a way to filter in place so there is no temporary list required?
;positive;Awesome, awesome answer. Thank you very much.
;neutral;How is it invariant if you're using the current culture?
;neutral;With perl you could do this:
;positive;I always seem to use Get when working with data (strongly typed or otherwise) from the database and I have never really needed to use Fill although I just as easily could use Fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data. Can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method? In what situations is it preferable to use one or the other? Any performance implications? Thanks in advance for the answers! I love this community!
;positive;G'day, One of the best recommendations I can make is to read the relevant section(s) of Steve McConnell's Code Complete (). He has an excellent discussion on naming techniques. HTH cheers, Rob
;neutral;This, of course, depends on your debugger. Can you elaborate?
;positive;Code samples would be great!
;negative;I'm afraid I can't really accept an answer here as it turns out that it can't really be done, without using a workaround, which I didn't want to do. Sorry!

;positive;I always recommend for a good starting point for beginners - especially those who have seen SQL but never understood how to build up a query them selves or how they work. All Celko's books are great. Hernandez's Mere Mortals book is good. Ken Henderson's books are also excellent.
;neutral;There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own, but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized, or massive and completely ridiculous. Carried to it's logical conclusion, a complete wrapper for all aspects of an operating system becomes an entire virtual runtime. You might as well make your own programming language.
;positive;@USER Great success! Thanks for the link, post it as an answer and I'll accept
;negative;I have a custom UITableViewController class that is shared among a few ViewControllers of my app. I would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page. However, I noticed that if the user scrolls up and then down again, my VC will trigger another fetching. So I came up with a flag isFetching which checks to prevent double fetching. Unfortunately I am running asynchronous code and I need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed. FeedVC: Delegate: I find it very painful to pass around a finish bloc in order to flip a boolean. does anyone have a better recommendation?
;negative;You could achieve all this with reflection but it would lead to a really horrible code. You'd better access individual members of the view model:

;neutral;IronPyton is your thingy dawg
;neutral;Not unless your Java framework is horribly inefficient, or for apps in which the db server does 99% of the work.
;positive;This is better than mine. Didn't know you could do a string array for formats. Very nice!
;positive;Thank you for all the great answers! Sam & Talljoe's answers accomplished this most simply using Linq. Thx again!
;neutral;lint is constantly updated... so why would you want a more recent one. BTW flexelint is lint

;neutral;"I am using Hibernate for my persistence layer. And if I send a web request which asks for some database data to be displayed on the webpage For the first one or two times, the server responds rightly and data are retrieved and displayed. However, when the same request is sent repeatedly ( Just by refreshing the browser by hand to resend the request), Hibernate will not respond anything. And it is choked there! Also the log message stays at the ""opening hibernate session"" line(shown by SessionFactoryUtils class in Spring) Any solution??"
;neutral;You should prepare your statement only once, outside of the loop, and then bind the parameters in the loop. This is why prepared statements have bind parameters - so you can reuse the prepared statement. Hibernate does exactly this, treating all SQL as a prepared statement behind the scenes, though you can obviously abuse this if you use literal rather than bind parameters.
;neutral;Given a handle of type HWND is it possible to confirm that the handle represents a real window?
;positive;In my company, we are currently using Qt and are very happy with it. I personnally never had to move a MFC-app into using the Qt framework, but here is something which might be of some interest for you : It's part of Qt-Solutions, so this means you'll have to buy a Qt license along with a Qt-Solutions license. (edit: ) I hope this helps !

;positive;Please do have a look at django-rest-framework, I just stepped over from tastypie to this new framework, works great! Especially the class based views and the browsable api! and many other advantages (e..g. to upload images)
;negative;It's a command-line tool. Unforunately Xcode doesn't use CodeSense for editing files outside a project, which is incredibly frustrating.
;neutral;What kinds of considerations are there for migrating an application from NHibernate 1.2 to 2.0? What are breaking changes vs. recommended changes? Are there mapping issues?
;positive;I have two namespaces: 1) Foo.Bar 2) Another.Foo.Bar From a class in namespace 2, how do I reference a class in namespace 1? Using Foo.Bar leaves you in namespace 2 still... I hope this is reasonably clear! Thanks.
;neutral;templates are not inheritance
;positive;How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder, you can easily check the build dependencies, and by testing it within a pbuilder environment, you can check the dependencies.
;positive;Basically I am looking for the guidelines for How to approach on hard ware sizing for a given requirements.what are the parameters need to consider to arrive at sizing decisons. It will be really great if any body can help on identifing sizing details for appserver, webserver,database etc..Please
;neutral;TLDs must go under META-INF too.
;positive;The sollution suggested over here is perfect: I register a BroadCastListener on all Activities that should be removed from the backstack and when I reach the main menu, I just send the broadcast and all receivers call finish(). This works really great!
;positive;It proved the point. They are very excited about SO now.
;positive;This is definitely great for small stuff!
;negative;So for my text parsing in C# , I got directed at YAML. I'm hitting a wall with this library I was recommended, so this is a quickie. And so on. Is that valid?
;neutral;The point of the require_once function is that no matter the scope, you won't include a file twice and redefine a class causing a PHP error. So no worries about memory leaks, if the require_once is hit, the class def goes in the global symbol table only one time. But aside from that, yeah use autoloader.
;neutral;With regard to Peter Lawrey's note that you don't need instanceof for final classes and can just use a reference equality, be careful! Even though the final classes cannot be extended, they are not guaranteed to be loaded by the same classloader. Only use x.getClass() == SomeFinal.class or its ilk if you are absolutely positive that there is only one classloader in play for that section of code.
;neutral;@USER If you want to branch outside of .NET there has been a lot of discussion about Intel's which is a parallel library for C++.
;positive;We have eclipse manage things the way it wants, and use ant4eclipse (a set of ant tasks) for continuous builds. Works great!
;neutral;This question would now be more appropriate on SuperUser.
;neutral;"@USER - I didn't want to be guilty of ""Not invented here""; if there is a pre-canned answer, I'm game."
;neutral;You could implement your own malloc/free without worrying about the underlying OS.
;negative;It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
;neutral;"Variables ""protected"" are prone to be malicious changed by derived class? Should I use ""private"" in base class variables instead of ""protected""?"
;positive;excellent idea :) I just added, tests it and works like a charm! Thanks
;neutral;You can use the imageInsets property to move the frame of the icon.
;positive;excellent - thanks everyone!
;neutral;I have the following installed: (for VS 2005) (.Net regex compatible find and replace, because VS has its own regex syntax)
;positive;Thanks for that - I figured that was probably the best solution. Very good answer too!
;positive;ya, indeed very good thinking for a teenager!
;negative;Nobody answers here..sad!!!
;positive;+1 for not being afraid to ask
;positive;Thanks for the answers guys, all where to me really useful! :)
;positive;Thank you Gumbo, I suppose this'll have to do. I would've liked a more concise solution but thank you anyway, I never knew this js-uri class existed!
;positive;Excellent tool! Thanks for making it available.
;positive;Excellent question!
;neutral;@USER Edited!
;positive;Excellent question.
;positive;if/when you figure this out - you definitely need to share it back to the world.. I'd love something like this!
;positive;Wow, you are right, thanks! I'll accept Brians' answer.
;negative;Too slow and I prefer to operate in the same mode as my users. Also, I just really hate switching to debug. And its a waste of diskspace.
;positive;Kudos, great question!
;positive;That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.
;negative;I'm trying to delete several working copy directories, but I get an Access Denied on all the SVN files, running as admin or normal user. I've killed the Tortoise cache process, and cannot figure what is wrong. Any suggestions?
;positive;Loved all 3 responses! I picked Gordon's because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter (I didn't ask for this but I was able to implement that later). JBrooks solution was great because it had a smaller footprint and allowed me to leverage functions, and shree's one was a little too verbose for my bigger project but still did exactly what I needed. Thank you all!
;positive;Fantastic answers! Thanks a ton!
;neutral;For the record, this code is not thread safe without additional locking (which is absolutely fine, thread safety was never part of the design specs for this class).
;negative;I don't understand this part: One thing I've found with this is that passing the config around to all the other utility functions that I'd prefer and don't think should be a a part of one the the above mentioned classes can seem to get incredibly tedious. Anyway, look up on thread-local storage. You could make a singleton config object that is thread-local.
;positive;Version 2 of contains a debugger. And it works awesome! It is still in very early stages, but have helped me several times. Just watch out for bugs! :)
;positive;Worked really great! Thanks a ton!
;neutral;I would like to mention something I came across recently but I haven't been able to test it yet. There is a new program called FreeNX that has set out to be a replacement for VNC. Here's the link: @URL
;positive;Jeff's article is excellent reading on this topic.
;neutral;I really do not see the point why you would need to resort to using dreaded . But here is another option if you are using SQL Server version 2005/2008 Use Recursion
;positive;Awesome!!! You just saved me a LOT of work!!! Wish I could give more than just an upvote!!!
;positive;There is a plugin for Wordpress to help you with that. Hope that helps!
;neutral;MS Access is not involved here, only the Jet database engine.
;positive;"The paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the ""main line"" pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns. One of the authors is Robert Orenstein of Perforce."
;neutral;what about 3rd question?( When is it appropriate and when not?)
;neutral;"The whole purpose of J# is to ease the transition of Java developers to the .NET environment which didn't work so well (I guessing here) so Microsoft dropped J# from Visual Studio 2008. For your question, ""Is there a real benefit of using J#?"".. in a nutshell... No.."
;neutral;Additionally you may customize the parsing behavior by providing appropriate dependency properties.
;neutral;It just allows you to skip null checks in your equals() method.
;positive;I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : (THANKS AGAIN ROB!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder, and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
;positive;I'm using this code to launch a .cmd file: It works fine, but I want to actually see the cmd.exe window running. How can I make it show? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
;neutral;ISpellChecker is an interface, not a defined class. Therefore any class implementing that interface can be 'injected' into TextEditor. Whoever creates TextEditor can determine what implementation of ISpellChecker it uses. And this answer describes Dependency Injection, nothing to do with IoC.
;negative;what exactly is not working? it��s hard to guess ��_ you shouldn��t be using erigi to check for a substring: 1) it��s deprecated 2) use instead. edit: your code screams sql injection!
;negative;@USER sir, this is sad :(
;neutral;I need to know if my file is audio file: mp3, wav, etc... How to do this?
;positive;Very well put, I really like this !!!
;negative;I'd forgotten to put the code tags around it and everything was garbled and the formatting was terrible for about the first 90 seconds of life. Apologize to those who clicked quickly and saw the garbage.
;negative;@USER No, I never wrote the helper class, I'm afraid.
;positive;We are currently using PDE to automatically build features and our complete product. It works quite well. Make sure you use the right script for product build or feature build. EDIT: We've now migrated to , which has an excellent command line interface.
;negative;When specified as above, Spring distinguishes constructor arguments by order of appearance. The notation would only switch between setting the attributes by constructor to setting them by accessor. I'm afraid, this will not change anything.
;positive;Very nice! +1
;negative;I'll bet you that your main's function signature is incorrect. You use: but SDL_main.h wants Aside: You see, SDL does something really horrific when compiling: It renames your function to , injecting its own main function which, in turn, calls yours. Note that if this doesn't work, then you may be compiling with wrong flags. To be sure, take the flags by running: For more information, see
;positive;This is great! I figured I just had to redrag everything into the dbml.
;neutral;Different engine versions? Have you tried naming that expression in the result?
;negative;Dude I feel your pain, same issue here.
;neutral;Is it easy to create GLUT pop-up menus for my OpenGL application? If yes, how?
;positive;+1 for the docbkx Maven plugin, it provides everything needed to work with DocBook in a platform independent manner. It's an excellent tool even if you are not working on Java projects. @URL
;positive;Daniel Moth has a pretty good blog post about how to do this here: Best of all it is simple and free!
;neutral;I can't understand where the extra bits are coming from in this article about s-boxes. Why doesn't the s-box take in the same number of bits for input as output?
;positive;I know I've mentioned this several times before but Scott Meyer's book [Effective STL](@URL) covers these gotchas in a clear way.
;neutral;"Take a look at this class: @URL (new Thread(new MediaPlayer(PATHTOFILE)).start();"
;neutral;Is it possible to pass a an Objective-C pointer function to a C function?

;neutral;Remember to Include System.Text if you want to use StringBuilder.
;positive;Nice work !! Loved it.
;positive;The is an excellent resource for locale data. From the website you can download an xml version of the database, which includes datetime formats, number formats, and lots of other locale specific data.
;neutral;I've used a few times in the past, and clients really liked it. It's not AJAX, as it loads all the full sized images on page load, but if you were motivated I'm sure you could make that change pretty easily.
;positive;I can't comment (yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing Mr. David Murdoch's advice is the best for Opera ( ). OMG, what a lovely girl he's got btw. I've tried his approach in Opera and I succeeded basically doubling the input tags in this way: This way the 1st element is hidden but it CATCHES the display focus Opera would give to the 2nd input element instead. LOVE IT!
;neutral;How do I consume a key event in javascript, so that it doesn't propagate?
;neutral;Too complex, breaks the third rule of the zen of python.
;positive;Thanks all, for the quick and excellent answers. With this gentle initiation into SO, I am encouraged to use it more. Hopefully, I can help answer questions, not just ask 'em. Cheers.
;positive;There is reference information available on the MSDN website. If you want more of an introduction or tutorial, then Charles Petzold's book is excellent.
;negative;I'm nearly reaching rage mode! Can anyone help me with this?? I setted a limit on a CodeIgniter Model so I can only that set of results. Why is it not working? The records are displaying correctly on function call, but I'm getting more than how it's supposed to
;neutral;I've asked a related question at @URL
;positive;Excellent I was not aware of this!
;positive;Recently I've started Operating Systems course...now going through its contents I'm thinking about learning UNIX from its internals.Also I have completed a Computer Architecture course and really loved it.Can you suggest a good book on UNIX Internals from which I can learn the practical aspects of how the architecture designs work in a real life OS?
;neutral;The documentation mentioned has no clear path to completion.
;positive;@USER - Very helpful, thanks!
;positive;That would be very awesome, thanks! If you do post it I will likely contribute...
;positive;Have you tried: I've also seen samples that in the markup for the media display layout file they specify an element such as: Good Luck!
;negative;Whatever you do, make sure that you don't use Apache's DBCP. It's a horrible implementation that will actually cause performance problems, not fix them.
;positive;Both of these answers were really helpful - thanks!
;neutral;"I'm just designing the schema for a database table which will hold details of email attachments - their size in bytes, filename and content-type (i.e. ""image/jpg"", ""audio/mp3"", etc). Does anybody know the maximum length that I can expect a content-type to be?"
;negative;This reply is incomplete: we currently have an app that is leaking permgen memory and the number of loaded classes is absolutely constant. Both facts can be seen by using JConsole. We suffer from the same problem as the original poster in that we have no way to analyze the permgen in detail.
;negative;I want to change an image of an UIImageView from the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of the app delegate class. But I am afraid that this class doesnt know much about the controller outlet. What must I do in this case?
;negative;"I am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network. These files can be fairly large (500mb + at times). I was looking into sending it via TCP but I'm worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory. There will probably only be one client. Copying to a shared directory isn't acceptable either. The only communication required is for the client to say ""gimme xyz"" and the server to send it (and whatever it takes to ensure this happens correctly). Any suggestions?"
;positive;that's great too! awesome. thank you!
;positive;I came across this and really liked their gallery, not sure if the script is in-house or came from some free/commercial script out there ? Thanks
;positive;Excellent! I'll make it as answer, that you can hopefully accept with a lovely big green tick :-)
;negative;You can set the document.domain but if I remember correctly a few browsers (Opera) will not even allow this. I am afraid your answer is to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through
;positive;Try replacing... with.. Best of luck, hope that helps!
;positive;goooooooooooooood!
;neutral;Here, I see `BAADF00D` (bad food), `BEEFCACE` (beef cake), `BAADCAB1E` (bad cable), `BADCAFE` (bad cafe), and `DEADDEAD` (dead dead). Is this intentional?
;neutral;I only have one important piece of advice - make absolutely sure you can revert back to the state before you started the refactor without losing anything. Then just dive in and go for it. You may well end up having to stop and start again, but that's nothing to be afraid of (as long as you heeded my one piece of advice). You'll learn a lot doing it.
;positive;I might explain but documentation on MSDN is already pretty excellent. Consider visiting Following Links. Here is the link to in with Example -- and -- synchronization in -- MFC -- Hope these help
;positive;great answer - this code works like a charm on Mac OSX! :-) doing a few settings up front removes code duplication when accessing settings from many places, see @URL
;positive;Regarding WCF/FTP/WS-Attachment/DIME: Excellent suggestions and some interesting reading. These are probably the types of long term solutions that I will end up using. However if there was some short term solution for changing the upload size in IIS7 that would be excellent. Thanks.
;positive;@USER excellent suggestion! Code changed. :-)
;positive;@USER : Really great answer!
;neutral;+1 for actually *answering* the question.
;positive;I really enjoy using Beanstalk too. I few days ago I realized an iPhone app to get access to your account info on your iPhone, this is the iTunes link: Best! Pablo
;negative;No you can't. That awful thing doesn't work in managed mode or mixed mode.
;positive;@USER is correct -- you'll want to use the to do this. SIDENOTE: Heroku's platform API is actually incredibly awesome. You can use it to scale dynos, set variables, provision / deprovision addons, etc.
;positive;this one is great!
;positive;All the places I've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment, although the production env. has always been some brand of Linux - usually RH or CentOS. I personally use Windows 7 for dev., and I wouldn't use anything else. You spend way less time debugging the OS, and more time coding. This makes management much happier! (PHP developer mostly)
;positive;If I am using IIS 7.0 + Server 2008/Vista Enterprise, any ways from IIS 7.0 side to control the upload speed? For example, max upload speed at 1M bytes/second? Any configuration based easy solution is great! And any programming based solution is also appreciated. :-) thanks in advance, George
;positive;I'm trying to create a small snippet to allow the onloaded image to be adjusted to fit the users resolution. And then allow the user to toggle between the actual image size, and the adjusted image size for their resolution. Here's what I got so far: Any help is greatly appreciated!
;neutral;I voted up your question because I want to do the same thing.
;positive;"Got it! Thank you all for helping me reach a great ""Aha!"" moment :-) ...hopefully after I spend some more time in WPF I'll understand why this works."
;positive;Excellent answer to a very general question ! :-)
;neutral;I don't think that's fair, I never got too deep into WPF but what I did, didn't seem to suffer from these issues (in a lot of ways WPF was a more mature UI technology than HTML). The new javascript-based UIs I think work on a node-style event loop so I don't think the ui thread is even an issue. For all its many many faults, Microsoft does deserve some credit for how its dev tools have evolved.
;neutral;I'm looking for a reliable, implementation-independent way to clone an entire Document. The Javadocs specifically say that calling cloneNode on a Document is implementation-specific. I've tried passing the Document through a no-op Transformer, but the resulting Node has no owner Document. I could create a new Document and import the nodes from the old one, but I'm afraid there might be bits of Document metadata that get lost. Same thing with writing the Document to a string and parsing it back in. Any ideas? By the way, I'm stuck at Java 1.4.2, for reasons beyond my control.
;neutral;... or any rounded corners...
;positive;Excellent - thanks !
;neutral;"To add something to this (cause I found it while searching on this problem, and my solution involved slightly more)... If you don't have a ""Browse with..."" option for .aspx files (as I didn't in a MVC application), the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file, and right-click it to set the option as described in the answer. You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way."
;neutral;I am not sure how to fix this:
;positive;Excellent method for minor changes. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.
;negative;"Freeing the local array ""buffer"" is undefined, and probably horrible, behavior! You can't free something unless it was allocated with malloc() or calloc(). It's likely corrupting the heap and causing the crash."
;neutral;You really should look at an NIO framework like or . I've used MINA with great success in an enterprise chat server. It is also used in the chat server. Grizzly is used in Sun's JavaEE implementation.
;positive;Excellent job including the Fiddle! I still can't quite understand the question though. Could you include the output?
;negative;-1 for not explaining or giving details. I hate these types of questions!
;neutral;This should be moved to @URL
;neutral;How can I call a custom action dll written in managed code (.net) from an installer without using an unmanaged intermediary?
;positive;If you don't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2 () is an excellent HTTP library that includes caching functionality.
;positive;Excellent resource:
;positive;Not to worry I've SOLVED it!
;neutral;How much data is it? 1 megabyte? 1 gigabyte?
;positive;this is an excellent link thanks a ton! havent gone through it in detail. just glanced. but it looks really promising. Will read it in detail shortly
;positive;Excellent advice, thanks!
;neutral;"I'm writing a basic chat program, and I need to notify the user that the other person closed the app. I have my own protocol, and I've already added a ""Quit"" message. The only drawback is that it isn't sent if the app is killed/crashes/etc."
;positive;I've had great success with DockPanelSuite I may post some sample code to get you started but it's fairly staright forward!
;positive;Very nice articles!
;positive;I do know the iPhone prefers PNG. But also PNG-24 with alphatransparency? I hope it does!
;neutral;"He's got a point. This is what started the HTML 5 effort (as ""Web Forms 2"" by Opera Software)."
;positive;I love it when I find the answer to my question without having to ask - thanks for running into the same question I had and helping me work through my issues!
;neutral;"When I do: It searches the entire system. How do I prevent that? (This question comes from an """" to another question.)"
;positive;It may be worth taking a look at , it's a generic collection library for .NET which includes sets. Note that I haven't looked into it much, but it seems to be a pretty fantastic collection library.
;neutral;@USER Does it order pizza for you while you wait for it to complete? Well it should! My philosophy is, why make programs faster and more efficient when you can just make the wait more 'desirable'!
;negative;"I'm very worried about the following screen. When i launch ""Instruments"" in Allocations mode, i see every image of my app adding to ""Living"". I really don't understand how it could be possible..."
;positive;Thanks djuth, this works great and is very simple! I have to admit it is pretty limiting though, for example, I would love to have it autocomplete a staff name and then return a staffID but I can probably play around with what's added and parsed.
;positive;Your best bet is probably TcpClient. There's a great sample that does exactly what you're doing right in the .NET Documentation here: Good luck to you!
;negative;this api stinks, it is terribly designed and has lots of bugs!
;negative;"That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add ""Set children"" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?"
;positive;completely agree, there are excellent answers provided here to this question
;neutral;Links are fixed.
;positive;Just use Skype. It's free, it has excellent chatting capabilities, works over firewalls, supports lots of collaboration features out of box and plenty more as plugins. P.S. It is also supported natively on Windows Mobile and has good clients on other mobile platforms (like Fring on S60)
;negative;The other issue the number of variations in everyone's SIP implementation. Solving all of the integration issues would quickly eat up all your time. At $699 for OCS that just doesn't make much sense.
;neutral;This is pretty much Python-independent! It's a classic example of Unix interprocess communication. One good option is to use to open a pipe between the parent and child processes, and pass data/messages back and forth along the pipe. Take a look at the , which can set up the necessary pipes automatically while spawning child processes.
;neutral;Installing VS2008 installs the 3.5 Framework.
;neutral;@USER Does it matter?
;positive;Interesting idea. Best of luck!
;positive;An excellent book I have, which covers this topic, is , by Clifton Nock. It has got many good explanations and good ideas on how to decouple your business layer from the persistence layer. You really should give it a try. It's one of my favorite books.
;neutral;What Javascript keywords (function names, variables, etc) are reserved?
;positive;Thanks, that's great additional info Sam!
;positive;I agree: Awesome answer! Thank you so much for this borad overview (even if it may be a little bit outdated by now).
;positive;leppie, those are great news! I am looking forward to try out IronScheme!
;negative;This is sad. 2010 and VCPROJ files have to be maintained by hand so the revision control system doesn't whack it out.
;neutral;try deleaker or similar debugger (vld, purify)- must help...
;neutral;Having How to convert a to a ?
;negative;I've tried with Postsharp, but their current implementation targets 2.0, and it's getting painful to make it work. Should I roll out my own AoP implementation (I'm thinking of a very VERY basic and utilitarian implementation here) Or there is an alternative I'm not aware of?
;positive;My company has no current plans to move to vista, so we haven't tested compatability issues yet. Doug Hennig has an excellent article on the subject however: These links describe some issues as well:
;negative;Nope... doesn't fix it I'm afraid!
;positive;By the way, I upvoted you because I think it's an *excellent* question.
;positive;I use ApexSQL Diff. It is an excellent tool for doing just what you're describing...compare schema, compare data, generate change scripts. It not free, but it works well. NOTE: ApexSQL Diff only works with SQL Server.
;neutral;i've got the following code which runs a bat file. the bat file then runs some .exe .. which does some stuff. The stuff takes aroun 5-10 seconds. What i'm trying to do is leave the command window open, even after the process terminates. Is there any way to do this? Otherwise, can i get all the output of that window going to my debugger instead, so i don't need to worry about this window remaining? cheers.
;neutral;Nope, I don't think such a magic function exists. One workaround for this would be to put your functions into a static class, and add a magic method to that class (> PHP 5.3 only, I'm afraid): For PHP < 5.3, you could do the same thing, but you would have to instantiate an object and use the magic method.
;neutral;Is there anyway to do this in configuration?
;positive;Text to html and WYSIWYmG are really different things. A real time preview is cool feature... i've seen a great example somewhere :) hmm :))) here, at stackoverflow!
;neutral;Seconding Paco's question....
;positive;Does anyone know how to add an item to a list but do it so it's ordered alphabetically using jQuery? I've got the following code that just adds an item from a dropdown to the end of the list: but I'd like to be able to insert it in its appropriate place instead of just appending to the end of the existing list. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
;negative;In general, how expensive is locking in Java? Specifically in my case: I have a multi-threaded app in which there is one main loop that takes objects off a DelayQueue and processes them (using poll()). At some point a different thread will have to remove errant elements from the queue (using remove()). Given that the remove() is relatively uncommon, I am worried that locking on each poll() will result in slow code. Are my worries justified?
;neutral;"I'm trying to customize some TFS work items via the VS2008 xml editor, but every time I open a work item xml file it jumps to the graphical designer. All that gives me is a ""View XML"" button that doesn't let you edit the xml directly."
;negative;I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
;neutral;It is Dependency Injection (DI) - see Martin Fowlers' descrition here: @URL
;neutral;I doubt that you will find that much help, considering this is a technique usually reserved for malicious usage (bots, etc).
;positive;Awesome solution Binod, works perfectly! This was a lifesaver, thanks so much.
;positive;I'm sure this could be of some great help for you : Hope this helps !
;negative;My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow, I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in, and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?
;neutral;Delphi (since 2009) now has a TDictionary class for doing this.
;negative;The solution is crying out for the MSMQ solution but unfortunately the posting service is not on the domain. Is there anyway to post to the public queue that is on the domain from the machine in the DMZ? I could use a webservice to post but this is a extra component to maintain. The database table is the alternative solution but again it is not the ideal.
;neutral;One of the first cool demos in the 1.0 era was page turn photo book. The idea caught a bit of traction and Jeff Prosise wrote up a framework for it What I'm looking for is an update to 3.0 (or at least 2.0) While I appreciate Prosise effort, I'm not that thrilled about all the Javascript required to drive the application. Any pointers? This is primarily for a learning exercise, so canned controls are of limited interest.
;positive;Thanks for the link. That's pretty cool!
;negative;When I apply on()-handlers I prefer the following notation if I have more than one to apply: Does anybody knows how to set a namespace within this notation? I solved the problem in this case with falling back to a single notation: But I really hate to repeat myself. Same issue/question for using the off()-method with more than one handler. This works: I bet the off()-thing is a easy one, but I don't get it after coding the last 15 hours.
;negative;You should fix the libraries that are creating bad or non-named threads. I'd hate to debug your libraries' threads only to find that the names where changes elsewhere.
;negative;"-1 This is due to omitting ""var"" before ""a"" making it global and is unrelated to the question."
;negative;that is very very sad
;positive;"Although I didn't technically end up escaping the dot, your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative. While wondering how I would ""pass"" the escape code to the ""SQL"" server, it dawned on me: Why not use a ""SQL Pass-Through Query"" instead of an ODBC linked table? Since I only need read access to the SQL Server data, it works fine! Thanks!"
;neutral;Isn't it better done with BufferedGraphics class?
;positive;awesome answer! very helpful
;positive;I m really excited to know that html 5 has in build support for audio and video playback( I know its old news but I just woke up ! :P) . What is even more exciting is that it can play local audio/video files in matters of some click. I had a look at this , could not find any offline video player. my question is why is that people are not developing an offline media player which could just be loaded form a website ? are there some issues ? Thanks
;neutral;What are the LC_* environment variables ?
;neutral;Here it is:
;positive;Awesome work guys. Got to love the fact that the SO community are so fast that issues I can't solve alone don't particularly impact on my day! Thanks! :)
;neutral;I have a composite control, I need to get the address of page hosting it.
;positive;We've deployed 's Plot Pack in both ActiveX and .Net flavors with great success. Great API, incredibly flexible, provides a toolbar that lets users pan/zoom/customize. It's solid, has a long track record, relatively inexpensive, and is very fast. (I'm not affiliated, by the way.)
;neutral;I always tend to forget these built-in symfony functions for making links.
;positive;+1 big fan of your blog Jason.
;negative;Ew, that sounds a bit ugly! Is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit's initialization section has run? In other words could an instance of TMyObject try to use FLogger before it's been set in the initialization section?

;negative;I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin). One of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a Javascript function to put a button into that column. (Note: I absolutely HATE doing it that way). The point of the button is to open up a dialog box. This dialog box contains a checkboxlist, which can't be rendered in the grid. Somehow, I need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog. Since this is somewhat complex, here is the code: Grid definition: Javascript Custom Formatter: Dialog Definition: Remote Manage Roles JSP (trimmed): Since I get the id of the grid object via javascript, but use the JSP taglib for the dialog, how can I pass the id around?

;negative;This is horrible. First you're sleeping, which will never wait exactly the right amount of time. It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected.

;negative;I agree, I would use two functions. Basically, you have two different use cases, so it makes sense to have two different implementations.

;neutral;What about forgetting all the wrapping of the functor pointer, and instead use as the functor? that way, you don't have to worry about managing the copy in any way shape or form.
;positive;I did try the demo and did end up buying it. I'm thrilled (thus far). Thanks for your comment.
;negative;The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.
;negative;yes I'm having the exact same issue, very annoying!
;neutral;@USER The CLR does not manage native resources. However, if a process terminates, all handles are freed by the system (the OS, not the CLR).
;positive;Great answer! If I may update it to Rails 3, the json method now seems to be to_json. At least that's what worked for me... i.e. @contact.to_json
;positive;@USER thanks for your answer! :) That `class MainWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow)` was surprising but excellent!
;positive;Excellent - I've unaccepted the original answer. I shall try this tomorrow. Thanks both of you.

;neutral;Can you unaccept the current accepted solution and accept this answer?
;positive;Yes - that feature is extremely useful for writing upgrade scripts.
;positive;Great!.. works as advertised - Thanks aku. Voting you closer to the 5K mark :)

;positive;That's an excellent idea Jeff. Thanks!
;positive;Wow, great many thanks! File was Data!
;positive;Im using the AutoPersistenceModel in Fluent NHIbernate to map all my entities and that all works fine :D However, several of my objects have In the database there is a single comments table, and each entity with the above code, has its own link table to comments. At the moment what im doing is: for every entity. Is there some way i can set a convention where by all mappings to IList<Comment> are wired up automatically as manytomany with the above table name convention? Thanks Andrew
;positive;"I'm building a little script that changes content and css live on the page based upon the values of various input fields. I'm able to change the content ""live"" absolutely fine as you'll see here: I'm not able to get this working with the css method using the same principles though: Thanks!"
;positive;I've used Clojure, it's great for an ex-Lisper! I may do it opposite from you and learn Haskell next.
;positive;But they fixed it, and you don't have to worry about it as long as you set the correct doctype, to make IE not be in quirks mode.
;positive;@USER Excellent ��� that works! Thank you very much. If you'd like some brownie points, please submit it as an answer and I'll mark it as the correct answer.

;positive;"To Kev's excellent Answer - ""Working Effectively with Legacy Code"" by Michael Feathers should be required reading for people working in Software Engineering."
;positive;I'm using Rob Con's repository pattern also - absolutely love it. But i'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the Attach and/or timestamps. It's been a while since i've looking into linq + concurrency.
;neutral;I am new to fluent nhibernate and nhibernate. I want to write a fluent nhibernate autopersistence convention to handle creating the many to many mappings for my entities. This is what I have right now: It seems to work, but I feel that there is a better way to do this. Now my questions: Do you have a better way to do this? Do you usually want the Cascade behavior here? Do I need to worry about something besides making sure both sides of this association end up with the same table name?
;positive;No worries! Joe
;neutral;How did you get the name of the temporary table that the alter command creates ?
;positive;I need some drawings in my tableview. How can i do this. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
;positive;Wow, thanks for the answers! This helps a lot.

;positive;No worries - everything is easier with jQuery!
;neutral;I want to show my own custom image for facebook connect. How can I do it?
;negative;Terrible approach, XML stores data, not formats!
;positive;No prob. Good luck!

;neutral;It winds me up when `~(logical page N �� physical page N)`.
;positive;ROFL!! I love the comparison to getting married...
;neutral;SetWindowPos + SWP_NOACTIVATE does the job.
;neutral;You can try this.It works in my case.
;positive;Other's have posted equally viable options, so really pick the one that makes the code prettiest to you! :-)
;neutral;@USER : can I use that in VB.NET? I think it's not isnt'?
;negative;cat'ing a script to paster shell scares me. The interactive Python shell has different rules for, e.g. terminating multi-line statements.
;positive;This is great! Thanks +1
;positive;"I've used on pretty complex websites with great success :) One caveat through (this applies to all ""fixes"" i believe) is that you can not make a background image of an element be transparent."
;neutral;While this could work when I'm developing and debugging the solution, I'm afraid it wouldn't work once the solution is deployed and a user needs to change the settings.
;negative;Yes, same happened to me ... sometimes defines can be really horrible.
;positive;That's really an excellent post, thanks for pointing that out!
;positive;For an excellent event manager class, check Danny Miller's: @URL

;positive;@USER great :) keep it up! you even get 2 point bonus for accepting.
;neutral;"You can get IDs or classes on elements, but you cannot really retrieve the ""selector"" of an element. You can use `width()` and `height()` to get the dimensions."
;positive;There's an excellent guide over on the Android Training site: It's about efficient loading of bitmap images - highly recommended!
;neutral;If you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image (or your custom object) array instead of putting it in a local variable. Take a global variable Use timer (i.e. setTimeOut ) to check if the din contains img tag with class . If it does not find any matching element (and image_cleaned is false ) then delete that array. Then set . Then remove timer (optional but better).

;neutral;I want to be able to grab content from web pages, especially the tags and the content within them. I have tried XQuery and XPath but they don't seem to work for malformed XHTML and REGEX is just a pain. Is there a better solution. Ideally I would like to be able to ask for all the links and get back an array of URLs, or ask for the text of the links and get back an array of Strings with the text of the links, or ask for all the bold text etc.

;positive;Excellent pair of web casts (30 minute videos) where Patrick Smacchia and Filip Ekberg talk through some of the features of nDepend and how to use them:
;neutral;i would reccomend you rewrite the bad code. Even if its really painful.
;positive;Mono appears to have really come a log way since the last time I really used it. I'm interested in doing some ASP.Net development using Mono. I have used .netTiers/CodeSmith at work and really enjoy the speed with which code generation gives you a clean working data access layer. The question is has anybody used any code generation with Mono? I am open to learning something like SubSonic or NHibernate if those work better with Mono. Thanks in advance for any help.

;neutral;Maybe, things have changed since then?
;negative;Im maintaining a site where I need to 'click' a link with javascript. The href is inline javascript, not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead. Im expect this is bad practice (the rest of the site is terrible!) but I need to make the link 'clicked' with javascript. Im using jQuery.

Sometimes I can have as many as 500 books. I've added shadow to the with code that is this: When I add the shadow code, as seen above, scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy. Each image has a different so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls. Anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a without having this issue?
;negative;How absolutely terrible you can't set controls not to show up on the print
;positive;Google led me to solution (base64_encode). Hope this helps!
;neutral;Why? If this works, why spend the time and effort? If you really hate it that much, write a function that encapsulates that bit of logic.
;neutral;I ended up with a regular expression:
;positive;Great point - will change!
;neutral;There are APIs for real-time data. See my answer
;negative;I personally only use the 'm' and the 'p'. The rest is just zany in my view. It makes the code so darn hard to decipher. I did maintenance work on this guy's code who used semi-Hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable, function, and other identifier in the code. He used $ signs liberally to separate words. It was hard to keep the murderous rage in check.
;negative;"on the root window is how xbindkey does it. Be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though, it's very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process... And that's why, if it was me, +""echo 'moo' > /tmp/moo-fifo"" would be the way to do it. That way, you could also control it in any number of other ways you haven't thought of yet."

;positive;Congratulations!
;neutral;I don't understand why all the answers assume Rails. Is that indicated in the question?
;negative;Visual studio crashes as soon as I open aspx or ascx View from MVC 2.0 project. If I delete all bin and obj folders from projects, I can open aspx and ascx View page. But it crashes again after compiling. It started to crash after I moved strong typed model to different project. I got stuck and cannot go further, really frustrated! I'm using Visual staudio 2008 Sp1. MVC 2.0, Window xp sp3. .NET 3.5 sp1. Anyone can help?
