t83;positive;I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)

I am trying to delete a Document record, and according to my execution plan, SQL Server is doing a clustered index scan on every one of the referencing tables. This is very painful.

So I have totally killed the locale for any other users around the world. I would like to say. Give me the correct localized date for this users region but omit the years component. Since the date is being displayed as string, I am tempted to just fromat the date and then remove the year component by just cutting this out of the string.

t221;neutral;My suggestion is to keep track of whether or not you're showing an error at that choke point. If you have lots of places that are doing it, you'd need to synchronize them somehow, e.g. delegate to a singleton object that is responsible for displaying the UI, or use a mutex or something.
t223;neutral;No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice. As this is a very painful task.have a good luck.

t278;negative;I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.
t279;positive;that's great too! awesome. thank you!
t281;positive;If you are on 11g you are in Luck :-) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch!The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits...Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing (if you really want to code it yourself...) You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction. If the Update returns 0 Rows it can either be because the table is empty, or because two threads accessed the same row. - So we need a separate ending condition counting available rows.

Unfortunately I am running asynchronous code and I need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed.

t1733;positive;Your implementation looks absolutely fine to me! A range-based away subscript is a type for performance reasons. It does not copy the indicated sub-array, instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript.
t1736;neutral;This RegEx might work for you (it is very hungry-greedy): But I would advise to use instead. It provides the ability to use HTML's DOM. So you would work with it just like with XmlDocument:

Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.

t1788;negative;It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
t1796;positive;@eat Wow! Excellent point! I don't know why I didn't see that before. That solves the issue with np.reshape and now I can use that. No need for another thread. Thanks again!

Change the line ""TargetFrameworkVersion"" v3.5 to ""TargetFrameworkVersion"" v4.0 You will have to do these steps every time you load Unity(blah) but it does work."

t2101;positive;Here is an answer to a similar question: It's a complex workaround, but looks working pretty fine!
t2108;negative;I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered, , none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm, and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?

t2115;negative;Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters. Expected 1 error on the last remaining bugs in this program. Little background on the db: It has 3 tables (A player table (11 columns), a team table (3 columns), and an Opponent table (6 columns). These are both of the functions and I am fairly certain the problem lies in here somewhere or this function
t2119;negative;Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?

t2161;neutral;TLDs must go under META-INF too.
t2166;neutral;I think the first approach is OK, but you have to be sure to always have branch B updated with the new changes introduced in branch A. Otherwise if you don't keep them synchronized, these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain. SVN merge's are ok if you do them early and often.
t2167;neutral;Maybe this?
t2173;negative;I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it, it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen, so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.

t2203;neutral;Just wondering what actually happens after you exceed 2147483647 records?
t2204;neutral;In what context are you asking this question? Database type?
t2205;positive;Code Contracts are pretty cool, but they do have some limitations. They will only create compiler warnings, not errors. Also, this analysis is pretty slow on large projects. However, I'm hoping this technology will evolve and eventually be integrated into the language itself. It's incredibly promising!

t2396;neutral;If you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image (or your custom object) array instead of putting it in a local variable. Take a global variable Use timer (i.e. setTimeOut ) to check if the din contains img tag with class . If it does not find any matching element (and image_cleaned is false ) then delete that array. Then set . Then remove timer (optional but better).

In other words, the image (if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface) will be anchored to the top left corner, not in the center. My report will know the URL of the image at runtime, and I need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer.

t2921;negative;Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience, the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time, when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?

For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.

It would be incredibly helpful if the toolset was usable via ASP.Net (version 2.0 or higher), and provided the developer the option to allow interaction on the client either embedded within the web browser or external to the client web browser. It should be compatible at a minimum with Internet Explorer, but would be better if browser independence were an option.

t3071;negative;I completely agree with you on that subject. In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design, procedural code, no encapsulation, production code littered with test code, interfaces everywhere, hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.

It's incredibly feature-rich, has pretty good documentation, and an amazingly good support forum -- it's one of those ones where you ask a question, and a guy who works for the company that produces the software almost invariably answers it within a few hours. I used it with PHP and MySQL, but as far as I know it works with ASP.NET as well.
t3324;negative;I have a web page that renders the same in IE7, Firefox, and Safari - except when printing. IE7 appears to allocate too much space for borders when printing.

t3345;neutral;@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.

Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.

t4344;neutral;I've hit this before. It has to do with the fact that lucene, under the covers, turns many (all?) things into boolean queries when you call Query.rewrite() From:
t4354;negative;I have full control of the deployment enviroment, it's an internal intranet application. Office interop/autmation is horrible, and while the documents are generated by C#, we use Aspose.Words. I can accept using interop.automation for printing, going to give it a try.
t4356;neutral;No worries, just a tip for future reference.
t4362;negative;I've noticed this lag time also. Its really annoying when you go to /usr/bin to tell firefox what app to use to open a file and it lags for 10 seconds.
t4363;negative;There are an awful lot of C/C++ libraries out there, most no longer updated. There's not much for C#, but I have seen a couple. I haven't really used any of them in anger, so I can't give any recommendations. I would start with and see if you find anything of use there. Alternatively, a search for on sourceforge.net has plenty of results.
t4364;neutral;i've got the following code which runs a bat file. the bat file then runs some .exe .. which does some stuff. The stuff takes aroun 5-10 seconds. What i'm trying to do is leave the command window open, even after the process terminates. Is there any way to do this? Otherwise, can i get all the output of that window going to my debugger instead, so i don't need to worry about this window remaining? cheers.
t4368;neutral;One of the first cool demos in the 1.0 era was page turn photo book. The idea caught a bit of traction and Jeff Prosise wrote up a framework for it What I'm looking for is an update to 3.0 (or at least 2.0) While I appreciate Prosise effort, I'm not that thrilled about all the Javascript required to drive the application. Any pointers? This is primarily for a learning exercise, so canned controls are of limited interest.
t4372;negative;Dude I feel your pain, same issue here.
t4375;positive;Excellent. This just saved me hours of work.
t4378;positive;Regarding WCF/FTP/WS-Attachment/DIME: Excellent suggestions and some interesting reading. These are probably the types of long term solutions that I will end up using. However if there was some short term solution for changing the upload size in IIS7 that would be excellent. Thanks.
t4381;positive;Thanks for the answers. I've found a great sitemap generator over at codeplex. If anyone is interested you can check it out here: Enjoy!

t4390;neutral;He might say he didn't work on the Mac port of Excel :p
t4391;neutral;We're looking for a package to help identify and automatically rotate faxed TIFF images based on a watermark or logo. We use libtiff for rotation currently, but don't know of any other libraries or packages I can use for detecting this logo and determining how to rotate the images. I have done some basic work with OpenCV but I'm not sure that it is the right tool for this job. I would prefer to use C/C++ but Java, Perl, or PHP would be acceptable too.
t4398;positive;Jim did a great job!
t4399;neutral;"I want to limit my users to a directory and its sub directories but the ""Parent Directory"" button allows them to browse to an arbitraty directory. How should I go about doing that?"
t4406;positive;Dave, very nice!! I didn't know that was in there. Now that I know what to look for, I was able to find an article with a small code sample on how to use it: On a related note, I also found the that looks extremely easy to use.
t4407;neutral;When you find yourself doing this, you need to ask yourself if this is the intended way of getting your server started. You shouldn't worry about this and make sure your python and django paths are set correctly. This is ignoring the actual problem.
t4411;positive;@StoneFree welcome to the future brave time traveller! :o)
t4413;positive;This library is fantastic, made my app much faster, thanks !
t4414;neutral;@yaauie - sure, I could have put a `raise 'oh no' if methods.include?(:after_initialize)` before the monkeypatch, but that would make the example harder to understand... It's so easy to get caught up in detailing all the edge cases that the actual lesson here (just patch a base method in) would get lost in the noise.
t4415;positive;Excellent resource:
t4418;positive;"+1 from me, I loved the leap from MFC to Qt ;)"
t4420;positive;"Works great! And you can add ""desc"" after the end to sort in other direction. In which case the strings will show first. I like how this solution doesnt actually pad the numbers in the result output."
t4422;positive;Fortunately I'm doing *very* little with Office - really just trying to show the new features. Thanks very much for the link though - very helpful!
