@Matt... I'm an idiot, I used the wrong patch. Sigh.;-1;-1
Sounds weird to me... Could you package a (totally!);-1;-1
If that would be the case, this would be bad design.;-1;-1
Nice, I did not think about using the system tables.;1;1
Thanks Ram, That seems alike a definite improvement.;1;1

Here is addendum to fix (Sorry about build breakage);-1;-1
Heh, that's one hell of a bug, 275 bytes exactly, eh?;-1;-1
I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell.;-1;-1
I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.;-1;-1
I must have looked at this before my morning coffee..;-1;0
if so, can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy?;-1;0
Thanks Adrien for looking into this, nice explanation!;1;1
That sounds alike a plan. I love peer - reviews...: -);1;1
It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life, though.;-1;-1

Sorry about the noise, was trying out the precommit job.;-1;-1
I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).;-1;-1
So I also changed a test to test a non-ascii stopword :);-1;1
Tried some more stuff and realized I was doing it wrong.;-1;-1
This was a very bad bug, introduced by me being an idiot.;-1;-1
"I'm not entering bogus reports for the hell of it ;) Matt";-1;-1
who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?;-1;-1
Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion.;-1;-1
Of course, StrFieldSource is a private class.No it's not.;-1;0

Awesome co-op. Thanks, Robert & Mike, for picking this up.;1;1
It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.;1;1
Sigh, I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.;-1;0
Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh, but we did for fs.;-1;0
Actually that's what this change did, sorry for the noise.;-1;-1
In this case, data would pretty much just silently be lost.;-1;0

You may want to carefully examine your assumption about this.;-1;0
Pretty sure this was fixed by the time we released JRuby 1.6.;1;0
Sorry, I had attached an older version... let's try this one.;-1;-1
Sorry, that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980, not 6980.;-1;-1
Sorry to have not spotted this one, and thanks for your care.;-1;-1
Thanks for the report, and sorry its taken so long to fix it.;-1;-1
I'm happy to use it as the standard logo (i.e. website, etc.).;1;1

One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved.;-1;-1
First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.;-1;-1
If so, a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell...;-1;1
I looked at our distributed pom.xml and they're pretty obscure.;-1;0
Looks pretty cool. Fresh and minimalist. Love it :-) Good work.;1;1
Thanks Andrew - the patch was applied to SQL module at r525019.;1;1
I would love it in 3.3.2, will upload a patch for that version.;1;1

Cool, that's all good news too! Thanks guys. One less on my radar.;1;1

Great! Awesome work, Nick, and thanks for the clarification, Bill. ;1;1

Crap, forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI, it's not.;-1;-1

Not too bad though, since clearing out commitlog segments is easily done.;-1;0

That being said, I'm not totally opposed to making the limit configurable.;-1;0

In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.;-1;-1
WOW....you are right...I'm deeply sorry to bother you guys (and I'm also a bit embarrassed).;-1;-1

@mahadev - I would love to help test a patch :) I'm currently using 3.3.1 + ZOOKEEPER-744 + ZOOKEEPER-790, applied in that order.;1;1
The patch should be relatively trivial, but alike I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.;-1;-1

"Shit, there is an dependency. Please go to Preferences -> LDAP -> Entry Editor and enable the option ""Show operational attributes"".";-1;-1

Shit, my bad. The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo - I had not realized I ran the test-patch against a branch not branch-1.;-1;-1
I suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or Infinispan connectors, and is simply a (stupid) mistake in the federated join processor.;-1;-1
I'm not sure what the problem is, but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.;-1;-1

I haven't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8, but I will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as I get the opportunity.;-1;0
I'm very busy for the moment so I didn't know when I 'd be able to the change myself, so if you can, your contribution would be one more time really appreciated.;-1;1
but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application, My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.;-1;0
As far as the query shit, i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could/should do Thread.currentThread().setName(x) or whatever (and maybe restore after);-1;-1
And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place, it is only seldom noticed (or when it is, it is blamed on Microsoft.;-1;0

But it was not the only issue: we also want to manage priorities between the tasks, but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities.;-1;0
I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs, no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?;-1;-1
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).;-1;-1

I'm sorry Mark, I came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch I have found that by default it used WhenExhaustedAction = GROW and not BLOCK!;-1;-1
All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.;-1;-1
Just to clarify... you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS... Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?;-1;-1
Then, to make matters worse, since the mid-1990's I've been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I'm an amateur.  ;-1;-1
I don't care if everything is pretty or not, but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO (though I have not used it for years for just about anything).;-1;0
Damn, I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742, except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.;-1;-1

Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think);-1;-1
"Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening, after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ""ordered - cancelled = quantity"" which equates to ""1 - 1 = 0"".";-1;-1
Cool, thanks Daniel, we're actually cool with either updating it to e9ff8c4928 or flipping the write bit and we'll push the delta ourselves - whatever's the fastest to get to writeable:) Thanks, --tim;1;1

Sorry, I thought issue (and provided patch) were about cocoon-servlet-service-impl, used by either C2.2 and C3 but only now I see that instead they are related to cocoon-servlet-service-components (C2.2 only).;-1;-1
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.;-1;1

"* Replaced TreeMap with an Array of final 'Segment' objects ** (now very slightly faster than trunk) * Rebased for trunk * Removed the patch renaming SSTableReaderTest to SegmentedFileTest I didn't remove the builder pattern, because the alternative seems pretty ugly (copying the segments array for every append).""";-1;-1
"Ok cool, this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints, I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)""";1;-1
